# Part A

1. a. The table indicates that during the period 1760–1873, the growth rate of British industry grew from 0.6% per year to 2.4% per year. Of particular interest is that although the growth rate of capital was approximately proportionate to the overall growth rate, the growth rate of labour slowed down after 1831 and was overtaken by that of capital, suggesting that industry was increasingly machine-intensive and less labour-intensive by the middle of the 19th century than it had been a century earlier.

   b. Technological change refers to the process by which new technological advances are adopted within an industry, increasing productivity or cutting costs and therefore making the adopters more profitable and able to expand, and also pushing competitors to develop another generation of new technologies in order to remain competitive [@trigg2019].

   While in the period 1760–80 technological change did not contribute at all to overall growth, by 1780–1831 it had grown to contribute 0.3% of a total 1.7%, and by 1831–73 it was 0.75% out of a total 2.4% growth. This was equal to the contribution from labour and close to that from capital. This suggests that while technological change was never the largest factor in the growth of British industrial output, the _increase_ in the rate of technological change was an important factor in the increase of the rate of overall growth.

   c. Within the cotton industry a number of technological innovations took place during the ‘long’ nineteenth century that dramatically increased output at every stage of the production process. One of the earliest of these was the power loom [@beckert2014 66]. This greatly multiplied the amount of material that could be woven by a single individual in a given period (i.e., increased productivity) and also lent itself to the application of further new technologies for powering the machinery — first water, and later steam power.

   Another significant innovation was the cotton gin. This increased the rate at which cotton could be processed into fibre as input for spinning and then weaving, by a factor of fifty [@beckert2014 102]. Important points to note are that technological innovations can apply at all stages of production (if one stage is automated but others are manual, bottlenecks occur) and that certain technologies interact with others and produce ‘multiplier’ effects (in this case power generation, but also transportation and communication, for example).

2. Government policy made significant contributions to economic change during the Industrial Revolution. One major way in which they could do so was taxation. The British cotton industry was, naturally, dependent on imports of cotton as raw material, and on exports of finished goods to profitable markets. Government policy was able in several ways to ensure both of these things. For example, lobbying by cotton manufacturers ensured that tariffs on cotton goods exported to British India remained low, allowing them to outcompete more expensive locally-produced cotton goods [@harnetty1972]; earlier, conversely, the development of British manufacturing technology had been spurred on by the high prices of textiles caused by tariffs on imports into Britain. Foreign policy also had the potential for affecting the cotton supply, with some groups advocating for British intervention in the American Civil War to ensure the continuance of cheap slave-grown cotton; although it did not, the establishment of a British protectorate in Egypt did ensure a new, secure supply of cotton in its place [@hobsbawm1995 125–27]. The government also invested in infrastructure such as railways, particularly in India, which aided economic growth by reducing the cost of transporting raw materials and finished goods.

   Nevertheless, not all impetus for growth came from the government, and indeed the free trade ideology of the time preferred minimal governmental involvement in the economy. Individual firms invested in new machinery, such as Samuel Greg’s mill near Manchester [@beckert2014 56–63]. Much railway investment and development was also private. Banks also enabled further economic growth by making funds for investment available to firms which otherwise would not have been able to access them — the capital-intensive nature of nineteenth-century industry meant that large up-front investments were necessary compared with previous centuries. Such investments were also made easier and safer by government legislation permitting limited-liability joint-stock enterprises [@hobsbawm1999 97], the creation of which had previously been possible only by a specific Act of Parliament. The role of firms in driving economic growth was therefore more direct than that of governments: by investing their profits into new factories and new technologies and thus increasing their own profits. The government’s role by comparison was often simply to provide the context in which firms could increase their profits, but in turn firms often required government intervention when they were unable to act individually.

# Part B

My academic background is in the humanities (history), so while I’m reasonably comfortable with writing and the more qualitative side of economic analysis, I have to take more care over the quantitative side in order to ensure that I’m interpreting the evidence correctly. I wouldn’t consider myself bad with numbers, but I don’t use mathematical skills particularly regularly either.

My goal in studying this module is to develop some economic skills in preparation for postgraduate study in history. As such I’d like to continue to improve my writing as well, in order to be able to use economic evidence within historical writing.
