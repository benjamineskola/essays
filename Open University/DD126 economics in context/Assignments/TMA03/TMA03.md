# Part A

1.  a.  Nominal wages are wages as expressed in terms of currency; i.e., the wages actually agreed in a labour contract. Real wages are the wages after changes to the cost of living are factored in, i.e., accounting for the varying rate of inflation, and would be expressed in relation to a particular year.

    b.  Wage inequality refers to the fact that workers may be paid differently based on sector, job role, skills or seniority, gender or ethnicity, or other factors. It may be measured in terms of the ratio between the highest and lowest wages, or the ratio between the wages of any two groups (e.g., the average wage of men versus the average wage of women).

    c.  i.  One reason wages can vary with occupation is that more skilled occupations will have fewer qualified potential workers, i.e., a lower supply of labour, leading to a higher equilibrium wage for a given level of demand.

        ii. The table shows that year-on-year, nominal wages increased for every category of worker in almost all cases (only managers saw a decrease, between 2013 and 2015); that despite this, real wages did not always increase and in several cases decreased; and that consequently, the rate of inflation must have increased significantly in those years.

        For each occupation compared, primary occupation wages are a larger proportion of the compared wage in 2017 than in 2011; i.e., in each case, the wage gap has fallen slightly.

      2006   59.8
      2007   60.3

      2009   61.3
      2010   61.2
      2011   59.6
      2012   59.4
      2013   58.9
      2014   58.5
      2015   57.7
      2016   57.9
      2017   58

    b.  Over the studied period the income share of GDP varied between 57.7% and 61.3%, with an average of 59.4%. Over the entire period, the share fell 1.9 percentage points, but this was not a steady fall; rather, there was an increase (albeit unsteady) from 2004 to a peak in 2009, a total of 1.9 percentage points growth. This was followed by a steady decline by 3.6 percentage points over the following years until 2015, and subsequently a slight recovery (0.3 percentage points).

        Comparing table 2 with table 1 shows that while the gap between the highest and lowest wages has decreased slightly, wages as a share of GDP have not increased, which might suggest that the decrease in inequality came about as a result of reducing the highest wages rather than increasing the lowest wages.

# Part B

Arguments in favour of income inequality will generally make one of two overlapping claims. First, that inequality is a necessary evil, because policies that attempt to reduce inequality are likely to have negative side effects and ultimately cause more harm than good. Second, that inequality is not a necessary evil, but has direct benefits in itself.

The first claim can be seen in critiques of, for example, minimum-wage laws. Basing their argument on a supply-and-demand model, critics will claim that if the minimum wage is set above the equilibrium wage, demand for labour will fall, as not every employer who could afford to employ a worker at the equilibrium wage could still afford to do so at the higher minimum wage. In this way, an attempt to reduce inequality actually creates unemployment and thus an overall negative economic impact through reduced productivity and increased spending on unemployment benefits.

The second, stronger claim is exemplified by Arthur Okun, who argues that inequality is necessary for competition and thus innovation.

> A system of rewards and penalties … is intended to encourage effort and channel it into socially productive activity. … pursuit of efficiency necessarily creates inequalities. [@okun1975 1; cited in @szymborska2019a 58]

For Okun and others, the incentive created by the accumulation of wealth is necessary for economic actors to find ways to increase productivity and find innovative new ways to make a profit; without the possibility of reward, there would be no reason to do so. Through taxation, the increased productivity can then be used to fund social programmes such as unemployment benefits, ameliorating the worst effects of inequality. Nevertheless, there is little empirical evidence for Okun’s thesis [@rowlingson2011].

While criticisms of income inequality for ethical/moral reasons are beyond the scope of this essay, there are also a number of critiques on pragmatic and economic grounds. Demand for consumer goods and services depends on consumer income, i.e., wages; so while an increase in wages would lead to a decrease in profits (all other things being equal), a decrease in wages is likely to lead to a fall in demand and thus in turn a fall in profits [@szymborska2019a 55]. Furthermore, poverty and inequality are correlated with a range of social problems such as increased crime levels and worsened public health [@wilkinson2009; @rowlingson2011], which once again have a negative economic impact.

Governments have a range of methods by which they can influence levels of inequality. As mentioned above, minimum wage laws are one such method, along with policies that mandate provision of other services or benefits by employers for employees, such as pension contributions. Policies that increase access to employment also reduce inequality; for example, statutory maternity leave or subsidised childcare [@szymborska2019a 33]. Implicitly, too, legislation and policies to reduce other forms of discrimination (e.g., racial or gender) reduce income inequality by ensuring more equal access to better-paying employment.

In addition to this, direct payments by the government to citizens can be targeted to reduce inequality; for example, unemployment or disability benefits [@anand2019 212]. These can be funded by a progressive income tax in order to effect a transfer of wealth from the richer to the poorer segments of society. And provision of public services such as healthcare, and public health policies in general, can directly reduce inequality — an important concern, given the negative health impact of increased inequality [@asaria2016].
