# Part A

1.  For a given market price, James will demand as many bowls for which his willingness to pay remains above the market price. Therefore:

    a.  At £3/bowl he will demand 18 bowls, because he is willing to pay £4/bowl at that level of demand, but for the 19th bowl he would only be willing to pay £2, which is insufficient to buy an extra bowl.

    b.  At £6/bowl he will demand 16 bowls, because his willingness to pay for the 17th bowl would only be £5.

    c.  At £9/bowl he will demand 14 bowls.

2.  Demand curve:

3.  The marginal cost for each quantity is the difference between the total cost for that quantity and the total cost for one fewer units:

  13                              13               —
  14                              15               2
  15                              19               4
  16                              24               5
  17                              31               7
  18                              39               8
  19                              48               9
  20                              58               10

4.  The supplier will sell as many units as it can while keeping the marginal cost below the market price; if the marginal cost was higher than the market price, it would lose money by selling additional units. Therefore:

    a.  If the market price was £3/bowl, it would sell 14 bowls, because the marginal cost for the 15th bowl would be £4, higher than the market price; the marginal cost for the 14th bowl is only £2, but this is as close as it can come.

    b.  If the market price is £6/bowl, it would sell 16 bowls, because the marginal cost for the 17th bowl would be £7, taking it over the market price.

    c.  If the market price is £9/bowl, it would sell 19 bowls, because at this point the market price would match the marginal cost.

5.  Supply curve:

6.  A market demand curve would consist of the total demand of every consumer in a given market; similarly, a market supply curve would consist of the total supply from every producer in that market. Each can be plotted in the abstract as a straight diagonal line, without numbering the axes: demand from upper left to lower right, supply from lower left to upper right, with their precise relative positions and angles depending on the specific details of the market.

# Part B

1.  A fall in productivity will lead to a reduction of supply, meaning a shift of the supply curve to the left. As such, the quantity supplied will fall from Q~1~ to Q~2~ and the market price will rise from P~1~ to P~2~:

2.  While the “perfectly-competitive” model describes the behaviour of markets under ideal conditions, in practice these conditions rarely, if ever, obtain fully; the value of a model therefore depends on understanding its limitations, and where and why it might diverge from reality. In certain cases, the extent to which the limitations affect the model can be significant enough that the model becomes entirely invalid.

    In the example of the international rice market, there are several ways in which the model’s limitations may hamper analysis. The first of these is the presence of externalities. An externality is a “consequence… of consumption or production that \[is\] experienced by a third party” [@szymborska2019]. Specifically, there is a negative production externality: some of the costs of production are borne by third parties. In this case it is the impact of pesticides and fertilisers on the wider environment. While the revenue from production still goes to the producer, some of its costs are borne by others, who may need to pay to deal with the pollution either directly or through taxes, or bear the costs of health problems caused by exposure, or be affected by their impact on other wildlife.

    The perfectly-competitive model encapsulates an assumption that all price changes, or all the significant ones, are brought about through the process of finding an equilibrium: prices are moved up by the ‘invisible hand’ when they are lower than the equilibrium, and moved back down when they are higher. But the existence of externalities shows that this is not the case. Over-use of fertiliser might reduce the productivity of farmland, reducing output and thus increasing prices relative to supply. Pesticides might cause chronic health problems, increasing labour costs due to the extra protective equipment needed. Those same health risks may also increase the cost of living through additional healthcare taxation or insurance, affecting consumers’ expenditure choices via their decreased disposable income. These factors are treated as *exogenous* in the perfectly-competitive model, yet an argument can be made that they are of central importance.

    Other significant factors are also treated as exogenous (and thus presumed to be unchanging) in the perfectly-competitive model. Technological change is another which is pertinent to the rice market. As described in the New Internationalist article, the long-term shift was prompted by the discovery and application of new chemical pesticides, which initially permitted a significant increase in output, but in the longer term led to declining outputs [@westwood2008]. Yet in the orthodox model it is assumed that the level of technology is fixed for any given analysis: the Green Revolution simply cannot be represented this way.

    In the case of some exogenous variables it may be possible to set them aside, to recognise that the model does not accurately represent every situation but is valid for the cases where the assumptions hold. But for technological change, it may not ever be possible for this to be the case: for Schumpeter, market exchange itself is what prompts technological innovation, and thus the latter cannot be separated from the former [@schumpeter1943 132; cited in @szymborska2019]. And, while Hayek may have disagreed with Schumpeter in many ways, including the root cause of technological innovation (as well as in their politics), Hayek too considered that technological change was inextricably linked with competitive market exchange [@hayek2002, cited ibid.].

# Part C

1.  My primary challenge in working for this TMA has been time management. Ensuring that I’ve had enough time to properly prepare and study the background material has been more challenging over the last couple of months due to personal/work circumstances. In the past I’ve found that preparation beforehand is the biggest indicator of whether I can write an essay successfully, and that essays or parts of essays where I’ve had to learn the material while writing tend to be weaker.

2.  Due to the time constraints I faced I didn’t complete this exercise.
