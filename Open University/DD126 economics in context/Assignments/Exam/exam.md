# Question 1

> Using a diagram explain how the use of a price ceiling would impact a perfectly competitive market. Describe the disadvantages of a price ceiling.

When the price ceiling p1 (the violet line) is set below the equilibrium price pE (the red line), the supply and demand do not align. The quantity demanded at that price (q1) is greater than the quantity that producers are willing to supply (s1). The producers will be unwilling to increase their output above s1, because they will be unable to make a profit (or even to break even) at a higher level. So there will be unmet demand.

# Question 2

> Explain how trade can promote success for economic agents. Describe one way in which trade might not always result in success.

David Ricardo’s model of trade posited that under the right circumstances, trade between two agents (states, in particular) could be mutually beneficial, and produce better outcomes for both parties than not to trade at all. This was in contrast to earlier, mercantilist theories of trade, which treated this as impossible: particularly in the context of international trade, it was assumed that there was a finite amount of wealth in the world and the goal of trade was to maximise the amount of wealth held by one’s own country and that this would always be at the expense of the trading partner.

In Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage, both parties benefit because the value of the trade is greater than the opportunity cost. That is, if one country can make one product more cheaply than another can, but another product would be less cheap to make, it may make sense to specialise in the production of the first product and use the profits from that to finance the import of the products it cannot make so cheaply. This model could help to explain, for example, the cotton industry during the Industrial Revolution: the UK exported finished cotton goods, which it could produce more cheaply than the rest of the world due to its advances in mechanical production methods, and used the income from this to fund development, both of further technological advancements and of quality-of-life improvements. In turn, the UK’s trading partners benefited from a supply of cheaper fabric than had previously been available, allowing them to invest the savings in other areas.

However, as with many things in economics, Ricardo’s model of trade assumes ideal conditions which might not exist in reality. To build on the previous example, the UK’s cotton trade did not exist in a perfectly free market, but involved British political control over India, which was both one source of raw cotton and also a major market for finished cotton goods. This meant, for example, that the UK could set tariffs on Indian imports and exports to the benefit of British industry rather than Indian, maximising British profits at the expense of Indian development. The cotton industry also relied, until the 1860s, on the USA as a source of cheap raw cotton (of better quality than Indian cotton), whose price was artificially low due to the use of slave labour: while the industry might have meant success for a Manchester factory owner or Liverpool shipping magnate, it is clearly not success for the enslaved people in question.

# Question 4

> Explain the role of trade unions in labour markets. Outline the advantages and disadvantages of trade unions in the success of labour.

Trade unions enable collective bargaining among workers, to attempt to increase the influence the workers have in setting prices in the labour market. Instead of wages being negotiated on an individual basis between each employer and each worker, a union can negotiate on behalf of all of its members as a bloc, so that an employer must set a wage for all of its employees (or all of those who are union members); in some cases, unions might negotiate pay or conditions with all employers in a particular industry.

For a worker, the advantage of this is straightforward: the labour market is rarely, if ever, an ideal perfectly-competitive market, and in many cases the deviations from the ideal work in favour of an employer. For example, the labour market tends to lack perfect information: it is commonplace for wages to be kept secret, so that while an employer will know the wages of all of its employees, an employee will only know their own and be unable to determine whether they are underpaid (or indeed overpaid) relative to the market rate, leading to a disadvantage in wage negotiations.

There are further advantages for workers: for example, if working conditions are unfair, a union can have greater influence on changing them than an individual could. Without a union, an employer can establish poor working conditions, and an employee who is unhappy with them can resign and find another job; in most cases, this will not influence the employer’s policy, as individual workers are in many cases easily replaced. In a unionised workplace, however, union members can withdraw their labour collectively — replacing an entire workforce is a much more difficult task, and when strikes are protected by statute (as they are in the UK) it is impossible for the employer to fire the striking workers in order to replace them. Moreover, the lack of a workforce (even temporarily) means a halt in production and thus an impact on profits.

There are potential disadvantages as well. Arguably, by negotiating a wage above the market wage, unions can have a negative impact on employment rates by maintaining the wage at a non-equilibrium level. In the perfectly-competitive model of supply and demand, an inflated price would lead to a reduced demand for labour, and thus to increased unemployment. However, this is similar to the criticism of a statutory minimum wage (it is, effectively, the setting of a minimum wage by means other than statute). In that case, the problem seems to be a theoretical one that has not been backed up by empirical evidence; it may be the case that this is a purely hypothetical problem in the case of unions too. (Alternatively, it is possible that the failure of a statutory minimum wage to increase unemployment in the UK since 1997 is the result of other factors, and that trade unions do have a negative effect on the employment rate.)

Secondly, by making it more difficult for employers to fire workers, unions might overall increase the cost of employing an additional worker even if the wage rate is not directly influenced: this would be a deviation from the standard model’s assumption of freedom to enter and exit the market. An employer would have to weigh up the advantages of hiring an additional worker with the risk of not being able to freely fire that worker when their demand for labour falls again; this might in turn increase unemployment.
