## Part 1: Techniques and Effects of Shelley’s ‘Ode to the West Wind’

```{=html}
<!--
1
O, wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being,
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,
 
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O, thou,    5
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
 
The wingèd seeds, where they lie cold and low,
Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow
 
Her clarion o’er the dreaming earth, and fill
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air) 10
With living hues and odours plain and hill:
 
Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O, hear!
2
Thou on whose stream, ’mid the steep sky’s commotion,   15
Loose clouds like earth’s decaying leaves are shed,
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,
 
Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread
On the blue surface of thine airy surge,
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head 20
 
Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge
Of the horizon to the zenith’s height,
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge
 
Of the dying year, to which this closing night
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre,   25
Vaulted with all thy congregated might
 
Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O, hear!
3
Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,   30
Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,
 
Beside a pumice isle in Baiae’s bay,
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers
Quivering within the wave’s intenser day,
 
All overgrown with azure moss and flowers   35
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou
For whose path the Atlantic’s level powers
 
Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know  40
 
Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey with fear,
And tremble and despoil themselves: O, hear!
4
If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share 45
 
The impulse of thy strength, only less free
Than thou, O, Uncontrollable! If even
I were as in my boyhood, and could be
 
The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed   50
Scarce seemed a vision; I would ne’er have striven
 
As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.
Oh! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!
 
A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed   55
One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.
5
Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:
What if my leaves are falling like its own!
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies
 
Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,  60
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!
 
Drive my dead thoughts over the universe
Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!
And, by the incantation of this verse,  65
 
Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
Be through my lips to unawakened earth
 
The trumpet of a prophecy! O, wind,
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?  70

In ‘Ode to the West Wind’, Shelley is writing a celebration of a force of nature; in that sense, it has parallels with ‘Mont Blanc: Lines Written in the Vale of Chamouni’. In turn, it fits within a wider Romantic theme: that of a sense of awe at the natural world. Written in 1819, while living in Florence, it takes inspiration from classical poetry: another common theme in Romantic works.

The most fundamental of these allusions is the choice of structure: lines grouped in threes with interlocking rhymes, called _terza rima_, seeming to take inspiration from Dante Alighieri’s _Divine Comedy_; the fourteen-line stanzas form sonnets, likewise bringing to mind the Italian Renaissance [@pacheco2018 66]. (Dante himself was a Florentine and a writer of sonnets.)

Likewise, the poem contains a number of classical allusions: to a Maenad (l. 21), to the Roman town of Baiae (l. 32), to the lyre, an instrument associated with classical antiquity (l. 57). These imply certain assumptions about the audience: an educated reader might be expected to know the classics, a popular audience probably would not.

The effect of the rhyme scheme is to drive the poem forward: each tercet seems to flow into the next. Similarly, the use of enjambement means that lines literally flow into the next: the pace is relentless, like the wind it describes.

A recurring theme in the poem is the exhortations to the wind: ‘Oh! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!’ (l. 53); ‘Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is’ (l. 57). The wind is a powerful, superhuman force; the speaker wishes for the freedom to go with it, or to be taken along with it by its own force. This might lend weight to political readings, interpreting the wind from the west as political upheaval from America [@pacheco2018 67]: the poet observes them with awe, feels helpless in the face of them, and merely wishes to be borne along with them.

The frequent autumnal imagery can be interpreted in similar light: ‘dead’ and ‘decaying’ leaves (ll. 2, 16); ‘dirge / Of the dying year’ (ll. 23–24), ‘withered leaves to quicken a new birth’ (l. 64), but also other imagery of death and decay, such as ‘old palaces and towers … overgrown with azure moss and flowers’ (ll. 33–35). The west wind is something that will sweep away old, dead things, bring about a spring-like rebirth: ‘can Spring be far behind?’ (l. 70).

## Part 2: The representation of tensions between the past and present in _Dubliners_

James Joyce’s _Dubliners_ was for the most part written between 1904 and 1906, a time when Dublin could be seen as balanced between past and present: a major industrial city, yet no more than a generation or two separated from rural life for many of its inhabitants; the second city of the British Empire, yet without a Parliament of its own as it had had little more than a century before; in a limbo between the failed uprisings for independence of the 18th and 19th centuries and the successful one that was to come a decade later. Accordingly, Joyce’s work, in portraying the psychological and emotional state of his characters, finds a reflection of this tension between past and present in many of them, albeit often (though not always) on a more individual rather than national scale.

‘The Dead’, the longest of the stories in _Dubliners_, works as an example of some of these conflicts. It centres around the attendance of Gabriel Conroy and his wife at a party held by his aunts and cousin.

During the party, he comes into conflict with an old friend of his, Molly Ivors; their argument represents part of Joyce’s own contribution to the contemporary debate on nationalism and its place in the cultural sphere. This is not, however, a simple opposition of progress and conservatism; rather, they have conflicting views of modernity. Molly’s vision of the future includes Irish political autonomy, the primacy of the Irish language, and the rebirth of Celtic–Irish culture. Gabiel, conversely, sees no contradiction in writing for an English newspaper; Irish is ‘not \[his] language’ and he is ‘sick of \[his] own country’ (pp. 189–90). He does not see himself as a ‘West Briton’ (i.e., as an opponent of home rule or independence), yet does not seem to place much value in the nationalist causes.

There is therefore a sense in which Molly’s ideals are backwards-looking, appealing to a past before the English domination; this past may be at least in part a figment of the nationalist imagination. On the other hand, in rejecting this, Gabriel is not rejecting the past in favour of the present and future; on the contrary, he is critical of ‘new generation’ which is ‘hypereducated’ and lacks ‘those qualities of humanity, of hospitality … which belonged to an older day’ (p. 204). In essence, this is a conservative attitude, notwithstanding his fondness for innovations from the continent. Neither of them therefore seems wholly at ease with the past nor with the present; rather, they each look back to a differing vision of the past, Molly wishing to recreate (or create) it, Gabriel merely mourning its loss and hoping to be left alone by the present in the enjoyment of literature ‘above politics’.

Over dinner, further tensions appear, this time in a discussion over the state of contemporary music; the conversation is for the most part an exercise in nostalgia, the guests seeing the musical golden age as being in the past. This is not a unanimous opinion — D’Arcy considers that there are talented contemporary singers, but even he must admit that Dublin is no longer the musical centre that it once was, and that to hear the great singers now one must travel to ‘London, Paris, Milan’ (p. 200). In particular, Kate Morkan perplexes the other guests by reminiscing about the great singer ‘Parkinson’, of whom nobody but her has ever heard; debate exists over whether this is due to her old age leading to confusion (e.g., n. 67, p. 313) or whether he is simply lost to history and remembered by none but the elderly music-lover [@haslam2018 p. 70]. It is curious that an event described by a participant as representing ‘the tradition of genuine warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality’ (p. 204) should dwell so strongly on such maudlin feelings.

One further conflict between past and present comes in the form of Mrs Conroy’s reminiscences about a young man she’d known and had a relationship with before her marriage. Her memory is prompted by hearing a song that he had sung, and her husband draws an explanation out of her which dominates the remainder of the story. He becomes jealous, and is unable to move past this revelation despite its bygone nature. It is in part an expression of Joyce’s theme of paralysis [@haslam2018 p. 40]: Gabriel finds himself unable to react, shocked out of his previous intentions. He obsesses over it later, prompted to question his own motivations and priorities: he, unlike the young man from his wife’s past, has never felt so strongly that he would risk death for a woman. In common with other stories in _Dubliners_, this uncertainty is left unresolved, and the chapter ends with a sense of loss, as Gabriel’s thoughts wander from the death of the young man to the death of his aunt which he expects to come soon. The final paragraph has echoes of the conversation with Molly Ivors, as he imagines travelling across Ireland to the Gaelic west, birthplace of his wife and inspiration to nationalists.

Similar tensions between the past and present can be found in ‘Eveline’. The titular character reminisces about her childhood, with hints of abuse; yet she is clearly nostalgic, imagining that she will ‘never see again those familiar objects (p. 30). As the story progresses, we learn that she is planning to leave; yet it is immediately clear that she has doubts. We learn that she feels ‘in danger of her father’s violence’, and yet she has ‘consented to go away’, as if it is a favour to someone else, and wonders whether it was wise to do so. We learn that it is her boyfriend who has invited her to leave Dublin, to emigrate to Argentina and marry him; he is ‘kind, manly, open-hearted’ (p. 31), yet despite all her hardships, when it comes time to act it seems that her life is not ‘wholly undesirable’.

Her sense of duty comes to the fore; her father is ageing and relies upon her, and she starts to remember his kinder behaviour. Despite his flaws, she struggles to reconcile herself to the idea of leaving him for an unknown future. This leads to another moment of paralysis: at the moment she has to make the decision to step onto the boat, seconds away from leaving; he grabs her hand but has to let go, seemingly in order to board the boat in time; her fear of the unknown is imagined as ‘all the seas of the world’ in which ‘he would drown her’ (p. 34).

There are similarities again in ‘A Little Cloud’. The protagonist, Chandler, meets an old friend, Gallaher, who had left Dublin in order to pursue a career as a journalist in London. On his way there he ponders his own literary aspirations and he makes plans to have some of his poetry published. Upon meeting Gallaher, however, his rosy memories of his friend are brought into doubt; he feels ‘patronised’, and that he would be Gallaher’s superior if not for his ‘timidity’ (pp. 75–76).

Once he arrives home, his mood has clearly changed: he has forgotten an errand his wife asked him to make; when she does it herself and leaves him to look after his baby son, he finds himself incapable of soothing the child’s crying and loses his temper, shouting at him. Confronting the past (or perhaps, an image of the past tainted by negative feelings in the present) has led to a greater feeling of helplessness: ‘It was useless … He couldn’t do anything. … He was a prisoner for life!’ (pp. 79–80). Even when his actions have consequences — the baby cries more — he seems detached from them: ‘I didn’t do anything!’ (p. 80). He is paralysed by the confrontation with the past, with the realisation of his wasted potential.
