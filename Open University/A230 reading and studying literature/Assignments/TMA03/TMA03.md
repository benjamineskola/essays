title: Representations of nature in Wordsworth’s *Home on Grasmere* and Shelley’s *Mont Blanc*

## Part 1

To some extent, the feedback I received on each prior assignment has reflected my own evaluation of my strengths and weaknesses. In past studies I’ve been able to identify the correlation between my familiarity with the subject matter and the quality of my writing. With the first assignment, on Othello, the focus was on close reading and the use of language, and I struggled with this — I found it difficult to identify sufficient points of interest to write a detailed enough answer, and fell back on description rather than analysis.

The second assignment, Voltaire, allowed greater consideration of the historical, social, and philosophical context of the text, which I found easier, and I felt confident that I’d done a better job the second time around.

However, the downside of that is that I think I stayed too much in my comfort zone: I was conscious of looking specifically for details that I could write about within the scope of those subjects I felt comfortable with, and avoiding the close reading of the language that I was less familiar with. I think the feedback I received reflected that: a lack of attention to the use of alliteration and other stylistic language, for example. In retrospect I’ve also wondered if I did myself a disservice in this, since out of the first three assignments it was the text I felt most comfortable with and could perhaps have stretched myself in order to be better prepared for later assignments.

## Part 2

William Wordsworth and Percy Bysshe Shelley were both poets belonging to the Romantic tradition. Within that tradition, Wordsworth in particular is known for his use of natural imagery, of the Lake District where he lived. Shelley, too, while well-known for a range of subjects, used depictions of nature in his works too. The Romantic imagination involved a particular conception of nature and its relationship with humanity, contrastable with that of the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution, and this can be illustrated by a comparison of Wordsworth’s *Home at Grasmere* and Shelley’s ‘Mont Blanc: Lines Written in the Vale of Chamouni’.

Wordsworth begins from the perspective of “yonder hill” (l. 1): thus, not only is the point of view of the narrator described, but the point of view of the reader is also, implicitly, nearby, close enough that the hill could be identified. It locates the poem in a particular space, perhaps prefiguring the tourists who would later visit the Grasmere area in order to be closer to the poet’s inspiration [@watson2018 24].

Conversely, Shelley’s perspective is omnipresent: though a location is described, it is not rooted in one position but an overview of the whole Vale. His subject is grand, infinite: “remote, serene, and inaccessible”, “in scorn of mortal power”, “from the boundaries of the sky” (ll. 97, 103, 108). The mountain and the valley are large beyond human comprehension, representing unimaginable power, and no specific location would change this: “Mont Blanc yet gleams on high” (l. 127), and would do so no matter where the onlooker stood.

Wordsworth’s narrator, on the other hand, is placed in a more comprehensible scale; while the scenery is imposing, it does not reach the overwhelming heights that Shelley’s does: “Not giddy yet aerial, with a depth / Of Vale below, a height of Hills above” (ll. 18–19). The natural scene he describes is one which evokes comforting childhood memories. It still produces an emotional response: “Who could look / And not feel motions there?” (ll. 24–25) But the emotions are more clearly positive ones: “What happy fortune were it here to live!” (l. 9). This contrasts with Shelley’s scene, which is an awe-inspiring one, not an unambiguously joyous one: “The race / Of man flies far in dread” (ll. 117–18).

As such, Wordsworth’s imagery is distinctly pastoral: “clouds / That sail on winds; of breezes that delight / To play on water” (ll. 25–27), “a bed / Of meadow-flowers into a tuft of wood” (ll. 40). They are comforting scenes, familiar: essentially English, perhaps, though perhaps also unusually perfect ones. It is a Romantic nationalism, praising the spiritual virtues of the English countryside.

On the other hand, Shelley’s imagery is awe-inspiring, evoking gods and giants and the inhuman power of nature: “lightning, and rain, / Earthquake, and fiery flood, and hurricane” (ll. 86–87), “Yet not a city, but a flood of ruin / Is there, that from the boundaries of the sky / Rolls its perpetual stream” (ll. 107–09), “the rocks, drawn down / From yon remotest waste, have overthrown / The limits of the dead and living world” (ll. 111–13). It is not a comforting vision of nature, but praising nature nevertheless: a Romantic vision of a world beyond human power to control, contrasting with the Enlightenment’s conception of a world fundamentally knowable and harnessable by humanity.

Despite their differences, commonality between the poems can be found, for example in the use of meter. Both are written in blank verse and iambic pentameter, associated with the form of epic poetry [@watson2018 40]. This form brings with it an implication of grandeur, elevating its subject: Shelley’s poem, a tribute to the grandeur of Mont Blanc, and making this tribute in the form of epic poetry enhances this effect. Wordsworth, too, used the epic form, emphasising the deep spiritual impact of the experience he describes.

Wordsworth uses alliteration in several places. “sudden influx overcome / At sight of this seclusion” (ll. 5–6) gives an impression of suddenness, a rush of words, which is followed by a pair of nested alliterations: “I forgot / My haste — for hasty had my footsteps been” (ll. 6–7), with the caesura giving the impression of an interruption matching the narrator’s sudden distraction by the view. Then later, a doubled alliteration “Sunbeams, Shadows, Butterflies, and Birds” (l. 31) connects two contrasted ideas (light and darkness) with two connected ones (butterflies and birds: flying creatures, suggesting airiness and openness). “I sate, and stirred in Spirit” connects the fulfilment from the landscape with the spiritual nourishment it provides.

Shelley too uses alliteration to connect ideas: “works and ways of man” (l. 92) and “rushing torrents’ restless gleam” (l. 121). In each case, the alliterated words relate directly to each other: in the former, the w-alliteration highlights attributes or properties of mankind; in the latter, the r-alliteration connects an adjective (restless) with the cause of that restlessness (the rushing of the torrents). A repeated alliteration particularly stands out: “mortal power / Have piled: dome, pyramid, and pinnacle, / A city of death, distinct” (ll. 103–05) which seems to be two overlapping sets of alliteration: power, piled, and into the objects of that power, the dome, pyramid and pinnacle; but here the p-alliteration is interrupted by the d-alliteration, connecting it to the “city of death” that describes the broader scene.
