_Othello_ is one of Shakespeare’s best-known tragedies, a description which implies not merely an unhappy ending but a particular contrast: a character of noble spirit, meeting misfortune, downfall, and likely death. Othello in particular has continued to attract attention into the present day not only for its presentation of these themes, but also for its treatment of race, arguably one of the earliest expressions of the concept in its modern sense. In analysing particular passages, some of these themes present in the work as a whole can be identified.

The passage in question, early in Scene 3 of Act 1, contains several points of significance for the remainder of the play. Firstly, it is only now that we learn the name of Othello: although he has been discussed since the very beginning of the play and even appeared and spoke himself in the previous scene, he has never been referred to by name. Until now, he was “the Moor”, set apart from others and defined by his background — in contrast to Iago and Roderigo, who introduce themselves in their first conversation, and to Brabantio, called by name in turn when he is introduced.

The second significant aspect of this passage is that it contains Othello’s first major speech. Although he had a number of lines in the previous scene, they are in response to the immediate situation; it is only here that he is finally allowed to speak at length. This has several consequences: firstly, we learn his perspective on the events that so far we have only heard described by his enemies. Secondly, it is the first opportunity we have to hear Othello’s _manner_ of speaking — the way in which his personality influences his choice of words, and phrases.

This manner of speaking sets him apart from others in the play, particularly Iago’s bluntness and cynicism; it implies grandeur, majesty [@pacheco2018 37]; though he, like Iago, is a soldier, and unlike Brabantio just an employee of the state and not a citizen, his speech patterns set him apart as more than _just_ a soldier. His speaking has been described as poetic, even musical [@wilsonknight1930]; he speaks figuratively, uses poetic imagery, in comparison with the more plain-spoken characters around him. This serves to indicate his noble spirit, an important element of the tragic form.

Throughout his speech, particular patterns are noticeable: emphasising his descriptions by using sequences of adjectives, for example. “Potent, grave, and reverend signors”, “very noble and approved good masters”, “feats of broil and battle”, “round, unvarnished tale”. He embellishes his speech, again giving it an air of grandeur.

Othello begins by telling us some of his background: we learn that he has been a soldier since he was seven years old, though the last nine months have been “wasted”. He claims, therefore, to know little of the world outside of warfare, and to be unskilled at public speaking; there is, of course, a measure of irony to this, given his particularly eloquent speeches by comparison with those around him. This is part of his “otherness” — he does not have the same life experiences as Brabantio, for example, who can expect to rely on the safety of Venice.

This could, in turn, be interpreted in various ways in a performance; while a straightforward reading might treat this as genuine modesty, a more negative performance could use this to lower Othello in the eyes of the audience. An Othello who was to be portrayed as self-regarding and petty [@pacheco2018 39], for example, could read these lines in a way so as to emphasise the false modesty, to present it as intentionally deceptive and hollow: a grandiloquent leader speaking at length about his inability to express himself, hoping for undeserved sympathy in the face of accusations.

Othello’s language distinctly contrasts with the other speakers in this passage — the Duke, Brabantio, a senator — in its use of figurative imagery. Rather than “seven years old”, for example, or some other more straightforward way of giving his age, he describes his arms as having “had seven years’ pith”; not nine months ago, but “nine moons wasted”. Brabantio, on the other hand, though speaking of more fanciful subjects — magic and witchcraft — uses less figurative language.

The Duke, too, speaks more directly than Othello, aside from his figurative reference to “the bloody book of law” (i.e., capital punishment). Indeed, later in the scene he reverts to prose, though remains in blank verse throughout this particular passage.

The use of iambic pentameter is typical for the period — almost a stereotype of Shakespeare’s writing, along with his contemporaries. However, in a performance it could still allow significant flexibility. It could be intoned dramatically, emphasising Othello’s grandeur, or exaggerated even further to ridicule him, to present him as self-regarding. Conversely, it can be de-emphasised in the other characters’ speech, in order to further highlight the distinction between them and Othello.
