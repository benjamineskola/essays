The critic Peter Widdowson has argued that ‘the vast majority of Hardy’s main characters are in an unstable class position’ [quoted in @gibson2023]. A regular pattern can be seen supporting this: a character who crosses class boundaries upwards or downwards (or both, as with Gabriel Oak), or whose class is ill-defined or contingent (as, perhaps, Francis Troy, only half-aristocratic), or otherwise does not strictly meet a narrow definition of class expectations. Perhaps comparably, Hardy’s fiction also contains a number of examples of women whose position does not fully align with social expectations, or who are portrayed in a way that might seem to challenge those expectations or preconceptions. On the other hand Hardy’s writing also appears frequently to betray his own preconceptions about gender, even if they may have conflicted with his own personal beliefs. This essay will examine some examples of these marginal characters across Hardy’s novel _Far From the Madding Crowd_ [@hardy2008], and his collection of short stories, _Wessex Tales_ [@hardy1996].

The obvious place to start, then, is Bathsheba Everdene, a central character (and main female character) of _Far From the Madding Crowd_. Bathsheba stands out as unusual from an early point in the story as a property owner in her own right, having inherited the farm from her uncle (p. 51). At this point in time (prior to the Married Women’s Property Act, 1870) women could only own property if unmarried or widowed; a single women owning such a valuable property was therefore not only noteworthy, but an attractive marriage prospect.

It may therefore also be significant that her eventual husband, Gabriel Oak, is the only one of her three suitors through the course of the novel whose romantic interest in her began before her inheritance. We could perhaps read this as a more genuine sort of love: neither pursuing her for her wealth, nor envious of her for her higher position — in contrast to Francis Troy, who upon marrying her promptly begins spending her money on gambling (p. 255) and appears to resent his financial dependency on her (p. 265).

Oak’s class position, as noted earlier, varies throughout the book: having started out as a shepherd, by the beginning of the book he has saved enough to farm in his own right. He then loses his investment and promptly returns to paid employment, this time for Bathsheba; then, over the course of the novel he proves his ability and earns a position of trust with both her and Boldwood, the neighbouring farmer. Oak is therefore both the ideal ‘self-made man’, but also one of the ‘deserving poor’; after losing everything his immediate reaction is to prudently salvage what he can and then seek paid employment, refusing to consider his former profession as now beneath him — an epitome of Victorian virtue in multiple regards.

Francis Troy, likewise, does not have a clearly-defined and stable class position throughout the course of the novel. He is described as being the illegitimate son of an earl and raised in the family of a doctor (p. 165); despite his privileged background and grammar-school education he has enlisted in the army. He has thus failed to live up to class expectations; and yet his apparent success in the army and quick promotion to the rank of sergeant seems to reflect the talent believed to derive from his ancestry.

Troy, then, also represents another Victorian moral stereotype — the dissolute aristocrat, drinking too much and avoiding responsibility (the wedding-party and the hayricks in the storm, p. 238–251), and wasting his unearned wealth on gambling and other vices (p. 255). There is an ironic contrast then between Liddy’s claim that ‘noble blood will shine out even in the ranks and files’ (p. 165) and the reality of Troy’s relentlessly low morals.

Hardy’s positive portrayal of working-class figures as compared with middle- or upper-class ones contrast oddly with his portrayal of women, which seems curiously double-edged. To a significant extent, Bathsheba is presented as indeed capable of running the farm — insisting, in fact, on doing so herself, rather than delegating to an employee, and having no more help in the matter than the experienced Boldwood does. And yet, Hardy’s narrator persists in reminding us of her inherent flaws as a woman — women’s ‘carelessness or inherent defect’ (p. 118), or tendency to ‘snub [men’s] constancy’ (p. 160); Bathsheba’s having ‘too much womanliness to use her understanding to the best advantage’ (p. 186) or her ‘instability’ (p. 240). We get the impression, then, that Bathsheba, in Hardy’s eyes, succeeds _despite_ her gender: perhaps a progressive viewpoint, for 1874, if a limited one by modern standards; that women could succeed at all in male-dominated spheres was not, after all, universally accepted.

The other significant female character in _Far From the Madding Crowd_ is Fanny Robin, rejected by Troy and sinking into destitution. Her role, then, is primarily to bring about conflict between Bathsheba and Troy: Fanny’s death precipitates his abandonment of Bathsheba and thus, indirectly, his presumed and then eventually his actual death. Only a small section of the book directly focuses on her: Chapter XL, ‘On Casterbridge highway’. The scene has been called ‘almost melodramatic’ (p. xxx), but seems also to have a parallel with the previous moral contrasts: Fanny Robin, working-class and female, has lost everything as a result of her seduction and abandonment by the ‘walking ruin to honest girls’, as Liddy calls him (p. 165). It may, also, have been intended to make a real-world point; the magazine issue in which this scene originally appeared also carried articles about workhouse conditions [@gibson2019b 90]. Yet Fanny Robin is also the means by which Troy’s redeeming features are revealed, such as they are: his rejection of her is the result of her apparent, though accidental, rejection of him (p. 115–17), and his anguish at her death seems genuine (p. 293) — again, though, her primary importance seems to be the impact of her death on others.

In _Wessex Tales_ questions of class and gender factor in once more. For example, in ‘The Withered Arm’, the class positions of the principle characters seem central, as well as the gender relations inherent. The two characters are introduced in the first section: Farmer Lodge, referred to by his title, and Rhoda Brook. She works in the dairy, while he, if not owning the dairy, at least owns the herd being milked. Their past relationship, it seems, is widely known and whispered about by her coworkers, and she makes no secret of it to their son. Lodge, we are informed, has recently married, and Rhoda Brook is expected to take it badly.

However, Lodge himself is not a focal character in the story.
