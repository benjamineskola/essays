The critic Peter Widdowson has argued that ‘the vast majority of Hardy’s main characters are in an unstable class position’ [quoted in @gibson2023]. A regular pattern can be seen supporting this: a character who crosses class boundaries upwards or downwards (or both, as with Gabriel Oak), or whose class is ill-defined or contingent (as, perhaps, Francis Troy, only half-aristocratic), or otherwise does not strictly meet a narrow definition of class expectations. Perhaps comparably, Hardy’s fiction also contains a number of examples of women whose position does not fully align with social expectations, or who are portrayed in a way that might seem to challenge those expectations or preconceptions. On the other hand Hardy’s writing also appears frequently to betray his own preconceptions about gender, even if they may have conflicted with his own personal beliefs. This essay will examine some examples of these marginal characters across Hardy’s novel _Far From the Madding Crowd_ [@hardy2008], and his collection of short stories, _Wessex Tales_ [@hardy1996].

The obvious place to start, then, is Bathsheba Everdene, a central character (and main female character) of _Far From the Madding Crowd_. Bathsheba stands out as unusual from an early point in the story as a property owner in her own right, having inherited the farm from her uncle (p. 51). At this point in time (prior to the Married Women’s Property Act, 1870) women could only own property if unmarried or widowed; a single women owning such a valuable property was therefore not only noteworthy, but an attractive marriage prospect.

It may therefore also be significant that her eventual husband, Gabriel Oak, is the only one of her three suitors through the course of the novel whose romantic interest in her began before her inheritance. We could perhaps read this as a more genuine sort of love: neither pursuing her for her wealth, nor envious of her for her higher position — in contrast to Francis Troy, who upon marrying her promptly begins spending her money on gambling (p. 255) and appears to resent his financial dependency on her (p. 265).

Oak’s class position, as noted earlier, varies throughout the book: having started out as a shepherd, by the beginning of the book he has saved enough to farm in his own right. He then loses his investment and promptly returns to paid employment, this time for Bathsheba; then, over the course of the novel he proves his ability and earns a position of trust with both her and Boldwood, the neighbouring farmer. Oak is therefore both the ideal ‘self-made man’, but also one of the ‘deserving poor’; after losing everything his immediate reaction is to prudently salvage what he can and then seek paid employment, refusing to consider his former profession as now beneath him — an epitome of Victorian virtue in multiple regards.

Francis Troy, likewise, does not have a clearly-defined and stable class position throughout the course of the novel.
