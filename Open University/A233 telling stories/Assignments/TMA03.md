The critic Peter Widdowson has argued that ‘the vast majority of Hardy’s main characters are in an unstable class position’ [quoted in @gibson2023]. A regular pattern can be seen supporting this: a character who crosses class boundaries upwards or downwards (or both, as with Gabriel Oak), or whose class is ill-defined or contingent (as, perhaps, Francis Troy, only half-aristocratic), or otherwise does not strictly meet a narrow definition of class expectations.
