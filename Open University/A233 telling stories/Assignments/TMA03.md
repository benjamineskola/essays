The critic Peter Widdowson has argued that ‘the vast majority of Hardy’s main characters are in an unstable class position’ [quoted in @gibson2023]. A regular pattern can be seen supporting this: a character who crosses class boundaries upwards or downwards (or both, as with Gabriel Oak), or whose class is ill-defined or contingent (as, perhaps, Francis Troy, only half-aristocratic), or otherwise does not strictly meet a narrow definition of class expectations. Perhaps comparably, Hardy’s fiction also contains a number of examples of women whose position does not fully align with social expectations, or who are portrayed in a way that might seem to challenge those expectations or preconceptions. On the other hand Hardy’s writing also appears frequently to betray his own preconceptions about gender, even if they may have conflicted with his own personal beliefs.
