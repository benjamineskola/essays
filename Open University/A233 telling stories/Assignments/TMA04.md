title: Relationships between men and women in _The Bloody Chamber_ and _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_
---

Angela Carter’s _The Bloody Chamber_ [-@carter2006] is a collection of short stories best described as inspired by fairytales — not, the author insisted, ‘adult versions’ of fairytales, but an attempt to ‘extract the latent content’ from them (quoted in the introduction). As such they present a vision of gender relations which has been found disturbing by some: yet one which, she argued, was there all along: ‘the latent content is violently sexual’. The anonymously-written _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_ [transl. @armitage2009], on the other hand, has no such explicit intention — indeed, we know nothing for certain about the author’s intentions. Yet it, too, portrays relations between men and women in a way that might produce an insight into its times.

Carter’s story ‘The Tiger’s Bride’ is one of the most striking in the collection in its critique of the patriarchal family — literally, in this case, since one of the men in question is the narrator’s father. As the tale begins, the unnamed female narrator has just been ‘lost … to the Beast at cards’ by him — a striking opening line in itself, presented almost casually, out of nowhere, yet with unmistakeable bitterness.

The scene is sumptuously described: the ‘black earth and blue forest’ he has lost, the ‘withering candles [and] emptying bottles’ she watches with ‘furious cynicism’ as the game progresses. Her place, as a woman, is to remain silent, almost an ornament herself, even as her father gambles her life away (which indeed he is doing even before she becomes the wager).

The objectification is made explicit by the narrator when she lists what is at stake: her father would not only recoup all his losses but win vast wealth from his opponent too:

> _You must not think my father valued me at less than a king’s ransom; but, at *no more* than a king’s ransom._ (p.&nbsp;59)
