> I know that in principle the opinions of a narrator don't necessarily match those of the author, but I have to admit I sometimes find it difficult to believe that a narrator is expressing thoughts that the author doesn't actually agree with. Far from the Madding Crowd is an example, with the regular assertions about the nature of women.
>
> It's obviously more clear with a first-person narrator, where the narrator is a character in the story with interests of their own — in some cases outright deceiving the reader. And I think some third-person narrators are closer to that than others, feeling more like an individual in their own right even if they're not actually a character who participates in the story directly. And on the other hand, I think some other novels with third-person narration don't really have so much in the way of opinion from the narrator.

> Perhaps it's about a sense of irony; if the narrator was telling us something clearly contradicted by the events of the novel it would be more obvious that the author intends us to disagree with the narrator. And of course it's quite plausible that Hardy did have these opinions himself, it would have been quite normal at the time (and so this isn't an attempt to single him out as unusually awful or anything).

> I was thinking about the satire of The Custom of the Country, and about the fact that a couple of people on this forum have mentioned the feminist aspect, and it occurs to me that it could be read from quite different perspectives.
>
> On the one hand, as satire about a rich person with few morals or priorities in life beyond social advancement and further wealth, you could easily assume it's intended from some kind of progressive/left-wing perspective.
>
> But on the other hand, as the Spraggs are what might be called nouveau riche and Undine seems to gravitate towards that kind of milieu rather than the 'old money' families, it could also be read as being directed not against wealth per se but only these "upstarts" who have money but don't have the right kind of tastes and sensitivities. The narrator, at least, seems to be more sympathetic towards the 'refinement' of, e.g., Ralph, versus the philistinism of Peter Van Degen and Undine.
>
> And similarly it's hard to be completely sure of whether the book is a feminist one or anti-feminist. On the one hand it seems like (outside of the text) the author was critical of the social norms and educational opportunities for women that made marriage the first and only priority; and on the other hand, it seems like Undine is effectively being criticised for doing what society requires of her and finding a husband.

> It seems to me that the definition is quite fuzzy. The closest I can come is perhaps something like “fiction about something that could take place in the real world". That obviously excludes fiction that takes place in a different world, or a version of this world that violates the laws of reality (i.e., the real world but magical).
>
> But the boundaries of that might be difficult to establish. It seems like the usual categorisation differentiates realism from modernism and postmodernism — but aren't they really still fiction that could take place in the real world? The textbook suggests that perhaps they're actually "employing new forms of realism" rather than abandoning realism (p. 12).
>
> And another aspect of that is when do we stop believing that the events depicted are realistic enough to be "the real world"? Elsewhere the textbook suggested that some of the coincidences in Far from the Madding Crowd are so improbable as to be melodramatic rather than realistic; the final confrontation between Boldwood and Troy comes to mind (Troy arriving home just as Bathsheba has finally given into Boldwood's proposal? really?).
>
> I also wonder if my definition there is good enough when it comes to science fiction/speculative fiction, which might well be set in the 'real world' and told in a realistic, non-magical way but seems like it should obviously be excluded from realism. (Because, if it's included, then where else can we draw the line?)

## Part B

Thomas Hardy’s _Far from the Madding Crowd_ (1874) sits squarely in the canon of Victorian realist literature, and lay the groundwork for what was to become a detailed setting across multiple novels, reflecting rural life in the southwestern England of the time. Edith Wharton’s _The Custom of the Country_ (1913) details upper-class life in turn-of-the-century New York. Both use fiction to depict something about real-world society; while Hardy’s work is a more affectionate portrayal of a place he had many fond memories of, Wharton’s is a sharp satire directed against a world she too was familiar with.

The Hardy passage comes shortly after Boldwood has made his first offer of marriage to Bathsheba. Subsequently she decides to speak to Gabriel Oak about it, and to ask a favour of him. The Wharton passage likewise takes place at a time of romantic trouble for Undine, who as a result goes to speak to her father to ask a favour of him. Neither woman, however, simply gets her own way; both men resist the request more than the women are expecting or accustomed to.

_Far from the Madding Crowd_ is narrated from a third-person perspective. Though the focus shifts back and forth characters as the novel progresses, we as readers see events as no single character possibly could. For example, in the passage in question the focus is on interaction between Bathsheba and Gabriel. There is perhaps a slight inclination towards Bathsheba’s perspective; for example, reference is made to the ‘declaration’ of the previous day, which only she could have known about. Yet two paragraphs later she is referred to as ‘[h]is [i.e., Gabriel’s] mistress’; this is not a fixed, limited perspective focused on her, which surely could not have described her like that. Rather, it is an omniscient third person, knowing about Bathsheba’s private thoughts and experiences and yet remaining distant from her.

While _The Custom of the Country_ is also narrated from a third-person perspective, Wharton’s use of free indirect style and focalisation distinguishes her from Hardy. This can be seen in the passage in question; the perspective follows Undine more closely than her father. Undine’s thoughts about him are described: for example, ‘Undine suspected that his breach […]’, ‘there was nothing more irritating […] than his habit of opening the discussion with a joke’, and ‘she saw in an instant the mistake of thinking it would impress her father’. (The second is perhaps an example of free indirect style.) Where Hardy describes the thoughts of both characters, Wharton remains in this passage close to Undine, showing her thoughts and feelings about her father but with his emotions only discernible from an external perspective, as if watching him just as Undine is.

In other passages of the book Wharton focuses on other characters, limiting to their perspective temporarily, including their opinions of Undine. Hardy, by contrast, while following various characters throughout the novel, does not use this kind of focalisation to show their perspectives so closely.

The narrator’s tone can also be contrasted between the two passages. Wharton’s narrator is distinctly sharp, not entirely sympathetic to Undine. She was, the narrator tells us for example, ‘too much absorbed in her own affairs’, and there is a sense that when the conversation does not entirely go her way, she is getting what she deserves: phrases like ‘sentimental casuistry’ are rather dismissive of Undine’s self-justifications. This is reinforced by the consistent application, throughout the book, of scare quotes around slang terms. The disapproving tone in which she might repeat these phrases is quite clear.

No such disapproval of the characters is evident in Hardy’s passage. The narrator reports on their exchange with little, if any, judgment. There is a sense, particularly at the start of the passage, of a world much larger than human troubles: ‘the scurr of whetting spread into the sky’ gives a sense of the way in which rhythms of rural life are driven by nature — in this case, the seasonal necessity of shearing — and recalls also for example the nighttime scene in ch. 2 (p. 14–15) with its sense of awe in nature and humanity’s relative insignificance in comparison. The final sentence of this passage also returns to nature, though on a smaller scale, with Gabriel’s words being directed ‘perpendicularly into the earth or horizontally along the garden, his eyes being fixed on a leaf upon the ground’.

Hardy also makes significant use of classical allusions; the passage in question alone contains two, to ‘Eros […] sharpening his arrows’ and to ‘Ixion’s punishment’, and there are countless more throughout the course of the novel. This, perhaps, among other things, shows a presumption about the book’s audience: the sort of educated middle-class who’d have studied Latin and Greek writers, and recognise a reference to particular artistic portrayals of the myths, for example. Moreover, these repeated allusions create a slightly otherworldly atmosphere, again of a world larger than human contemplation. This may relate to the pastoral theme of the book, and the classical ideal of the countryside and a ‘golden age’ [@gibson2019a 56].

The allusions in this passage might be particularly appropriate: first, to the god of love; second, to a seducer who was punished for his impertinence. Oak, like Ixion, made a romantic proposition to someone and subsequently suffered, though his suffering is not truly as a result of the proposal and rather just made worse by it; and on the other hand, it appears that Oak’s actions have caused, in the end, Bathsheba to fall in love with him.

Wharton, like Hardy, was originally published in a middle-class serial, but her references are to modern culture and society. Wall Street; Masonic emblems; political representatives: even if the reader was not personally involved in such spheres, they could be expected to understand them.

But Wharton is not simply depicting contemporary society, but satirising it: its shallowness and hypocrisy. In this passage, for example, it is noted that Mr Spragg had ‘never quite regained […] financial security’ since moving to New York but that this is ‘vague and shadowy’ to Undine — yet, of course, the relocation was at her behest. He listens to her problem with ‘mild patience’, but she seems to find anything short of complete agreement intolerable — and when she misjudges how best to win him over, she becomes ‘angrier with him, and more ruthless’. Mr Spragg is perhaps a relatively moral character here, his ‘simple’ rule of private conduct held up in contrast to the ‘sentimental casuistry’ that seems to be the norm in Undine’s circles. Elsewhere in the book, too, characters come to him for moral guidance (Ralph Marvell, for example); yet, on the other hand, he cannot be blameless for Undine’s self-serving morality. He has, after all, eventually given in to every demand she makes, as he does in this case too a short time later; so he, too, cannot be entirely above criticism from Wharton’s satire.

The Wharton extract gives us a physical description of Mr Spragg and his office: we learn of his ‘limp beard’, ‘sallow moustache’, and ‘slow fagged eyes’, as well as the Masonic emblem that it seems he habitually wears, but also the ‘gorged waste-paper basket’ that he accidentally overturns, and the ‘dusty objects on his desk’, as well as his habit of leaning back in his chair as he thinks (seen also in an earlier scene). The effect is perhaps of moderate financial success, but under strain — as indeed we’re told he is. Of Undine, who is by now a more established character, the only physical descriptions given are those of her displeasure: her frown, the tightening of her lips, her ‘stormy steel-grey eyes’ as her anger at being defied increases.

The Hardy extract gives us less in the way of descriptions of his characters in general; by now, they are both well-established and need less introduction, and the focus is on the particular scene and their behaviour. Gabriel’s appearance as he grinds the shears is described in detail, along with the ‘melancholy see-saw’ of Cainy Ball bobbing up and down as he turns the grindstone. Then, as in the Wharton extract, the emotional responses as the conversation progresses: Gabriel’s ‘intense surprise’ at Bathsheba asking to speak in private, and conversely Bathsheba’s awkwardness as she brings up a delicate subject. Their conversation is interrupted, too, by the need for Gabriel to stop and instruct her on grinding, which he does by taking the unusual physical liberty of holding her hands. This over-familiarity is objected to by Bathsheba, but it is repeated a short time later when Gabriel refers to her by her given name.

Gabriel is surprised by the nature of Bathsheba’s request, but also, we are informed, relieved, reflecting the complexity of his relationship with her; neither she nor we as readers are certain whether he is still in love with her, as Hardy’s narrator makes explicit that his tone is ambiguous. He goes on to offer an opinion on her behaviour: another inappropriate liberty given their relative positions, and barely tolerated, if at all, by Bathsheba. Over the remainder of the novel she comes to rely on his friendship in this way, though it is strained both by her marriage to Troy and by her tendency, as here, to remind him of his position, perhaps out of defensiveness.
