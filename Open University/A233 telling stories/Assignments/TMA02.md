> It seems to me that much of the difference \[in how sympathetic the characters are] comes from the content, not the structure: Penny is less sympathetic than Lise because of what she says and thinks, primarily. Although, in that sense, the novel's structure allows Penny's personality to become more clear. If we only saw her through Else's eyes, for example, we'd know that we were getting a biased view of her, and perhaps judge her less harshly — is she really so unpleasant, or is it simply that Else thinks she's annoying? The switch of perspectives, presenting her in a more unmediated way, allows us to get more of a first-hand opinion of her.

> One aspect of the structure that does seem to relate is the order of the chapters. For example, when we read Lise's chapter we have already seen her from Else's perspective, and once we understand that these are the same person we might judge her sympathetically due to her kindness towards Else (and conversely, feel less sympathetic towards Penny not only for her selfishness in itself, but for her selfishness in comparison to Lise).

> Similarly, when we get to Clare's chapter we've already seen her from the perspective of the other characters and that gives us an understanding of her behaviour and motivations that we might not have if we read her chapter on its own (or saw the whole book only from her perspective).

> Hotel World has been described as difficult to read, and at first I wasn't sure if I agreed, but different sections varied in that, I think.

> Past (Sara's perspective as a ghost) wasn't difficult to follow, I think, though it presented some interesting ideas — the idea of a ghost fading away over time is not a new one, but experiencing that fading from the ghost's perspective was unusual (her senses and her memories growing weaker while she's still capable of awareness of that). Present historic and Perfect were similarly quite straightforward in their presentation.

> Future conditional jumped around a little, I think, and that made it more difficult to follow; but I think doing so also helped to represent the state of mind of someone who's unwell, who might not be able to focus and think clearly. I enjoyed the device of telling the story once, and then the narrator going back and analysing details one by one, explaining things that the character's own thought process hadn't made clear.

> Future in the past was a struggle. The ideas being represented weren't impossibly complex, I think; but the endless stream of thought made it more difficult to know when to pause and reflect on one concept before she moves onto the next.

> I've been finding the pastoral imagery quite striking (I'm not finished yet!). At least in the early part of the book, it seems to me almost like the primary focus is on the pleasantness of the countryside where they're located — and the anecdotes about the war are a regular, inevitable necessity as that war keeps intruding. I don't mean primary in the sense of how much of the book they take up, precisely, so much as that they're somehow more fundamental in his world view. The war is, of course, ever-present, and he can't and won't ignore it, but it's more like an unnatural, external intrusion into what really matters. He describes pretty towns and pleasant days spent swimming in the river — and then how they're ruined by the harsh reality of the war.

> I'm going to look out for, as you say, the conflation of nature and man — it sounds like an interesting perspective.

## Part B

_Hotel World_ [Ali @smith2002] takes the form of several interrelated narratives in differing but complementary perspectives. It explores the effect of the death of one woman on those around her — some close, some only coincidentally nearby. In doing so, a theme of boundaries recurs, challenging conventional assumptions about the binary nature of things [@davison2017; quoted in @doloughan2019 222].

The most dramatic boundary disrupted occurs in the first section, 'past', in which the viewpoint character has died and is now reflecting on her own death. This is a very clear boundary, perhaps the most fundamental of all, that between life and death, but for Smith the boundary is not an absolute or a permanent one. Sara, the young woman in question, has died, but while this is an irrevocable state she is still able to think, feel, perceive the world, and even to interact with it, appearing to her close family to varying effect.

Smith's afterlife is nevertheless unusual in its nature. Unlike the assumed reality that death is both permanent and absolute, and yet also unlike the common fantasy trope that a ghost may remain for some period of time due to 'unfinished business' in full possession of their faculties but merely incorporeal, Sara's ghost has remained behind after death but gradually loses her faculties — forgetting common words (including, poignantly, the word for the thing that killed her), finding it more difficult to perceive the world or to make herself perceived by the living. Death, for Smith, is not a binary state but perhaps a spectrum; one becomes increasingly more dead over time.

Smith also introduces another unusual binary separation, between Sara's ghost, immaterial but still active in the world, and Sara's corpse, material but confined to her grave. While the ghost has forgotten much of what happened to her in life, her body seems to retain its own memories; the ghost wishes to remember, the body to forget. And while the ghost can perceive and interact with the world she appears to have a curious emotional distance from it, habitually referring to her living/former self in the third person, and her family members in the same distancing way; she is both drawn to them yet remains separate.

This section, revolving around the experience of a dead person, also disrupts the binary distinction between realism and fantasy. _Hotel World_ deals with the classic subject matter of realist works: much of the book is taken up with relatively everyday experiences of relatively ordinary people and examines how these ordinary people have been affected by a death. Yet it also introduces this element of the supernatural, and brings into question whether 'realism' per se needs to be entirely limited to something that more or less approximates the real world, or whether (and to what extent) the real can coexist with fantastical elements and still produce the desired literary effect.

The second section, 'present historic', presents a social boundary: that between homeless people and those who are not homeless. Here Smith engages in social commentary and critique, an observation of late-90s British society that cannot be entirely neutral. We see Else ignored by passers-by, only occasionally having her request to 'spr sm chn' acknowledged. Her being homeless has placed her outside of normal society, to be ignored or worse. This boundary, however, works only in one direction: Else is a keen observer of those around her.

The boundary, we learn through her observations, is not uniform but varies in the strength of its effect. Else, who is currently unwell, is therefore even more invisible than usual (her cough and other symptoms, it seems, are noticeable to passers-by even when she is not). And, on the other hand, the girl she observes across the street is young and pretty, earning sympathy, far more visible than Else herself is.

In a subsequent section, 'perfect', in which we see Else from the perspective of another character, Penny, this boundary can perhaps be observed at work in a different way. Penny is curiously unobservant, seeming not to notice that Else is homeless for quite some time; indeed, her obliviousness is almost comical, particularly since she is a journalist.[^tabloid] Her self-absorption and self-satisfaction, we might conclude, are precisely the things that would manifest themselves as simply failing to acknowledge Else at all in other circumstances. Else has disrupted the boundary by being in an unexpected place: in a hotel room, appearing to be a guest, and so Penny has treated her as if they were on the same side of that boundary. She seems oblivious to any contradicting evidence, perhaps because having acknowledged the existence of a homeless person puts one in uncertain, undefined territory.

[^tabloid]: A satire on tabloid journalists, perhaps?

Once Penny does become aware of Else's homelessness, she's othered again. Initially we might think that this is a positive experience for Penny: she's learned to see Else's humanity, even claiming that it's 'made a real difference to me, meeting you tonight' (p. 173). But not long afterwards, she's come to her senses, re-establishing the boundary, cancelling the cheque that she's given herself and repeating to herself the reasons why she's right to do so, that Else has deserved her misfortune.

An irony of this interaction is that the two characters appear to have similar backgrounds: both, at least, were abused as teenagers (p. 60, 168), though only Penny shares this. We might wonder if their positions might easily have been reversed, if Penny might have ended up homeless instead. Certainly Else's worse position in life is not due to lack of education; she has an understanding of physics, explaining Galileo to Clare and Penny (p. 149–50), and poetry (p. 50, 172, 176).[^donne] In both cases, Penny is incorrect yet oblivious, convincing herself that she must be right. The boundary, then, is an arbitrary one, by the standards of common assumptions; Smith challenges the notion of a boundary based on any kind of deserving/undeserving dichotomy.

[^donne]: The line of poetry she mentions, 'I am rebegot', appears to be from a John Donne poem. [@donne2006a]

Another ill-defined boundary appears in the third section, 'future conditional' — that between sickness and health. Lise is ill, that much is clear; her illness appears fairly serious, chronic; yet we never learn what the illness is. Indeed, Lise is told that the doctors 'can't actually find anything wrong' with her (p. 89); medically speaking, it seems, she should be perfectly well, and yet she is bedridden. The boundary in this case, then, depends on how we define it: according to medical expertise, she is healthy; according to her own experience, she is not. We might suspect that her illness is psychological, related to the guilt of getting a co-worker fired if not the shock of another co-worker's accidental death (or suspected suicide). But a psychological illness itself is boundary-disrupting: having real material effects on the body, and yet being seemingly without physical cause, it might often be classified as 'faking'. This is also a boundary that is guarded and enforced: being ill requires, in some sense, the official confirmation by a medical professional to 'count', and those with an undiagnosed illness might find themselves in limbo, not officially ill in a way that could be listed on a form (as Lise struggles to do) but also not well enough to live normally (a state of affairs that particularly affects marginalised people: those who find themselves on the wrong side of another boundary).

Ghosts recur in the final section, 'present'. Ghosts, here, are everywhere: the ghost of a shopkeeper rumoured to have killed her husband, the ghost of Dusty Springfield where her music is heard,[^dusty] the forgotten ghosts of executed criminals haunting modern tourist attractions. Perhaps here we are being shown, again, that the boundary between life and death is not absolute. Perhaps we are not literally haunted; but the dead still have an effect on the world: whether it's an old shop sign or a recording of their voice or just a memory. Indeed, _Hotel World_ as a whole explores the continuing impact of the dead on the world: Sara's impact on her co-workers, her sister, the girl in the watch shop has not ceased merely because she has died: this most absolute of barriers is anything but absolute.

[^dusty]: She had died in March 1999; that is, shortly before the beginning of _Hotel World_.
