## Part B

_Hotel World_ [Ali @smith2002] takes the form of several interrelated narratives in differing but complementary perspectives. It explores the effect of the death of one woman on those around her — some close, some only coincidentally nearby. In doing so, a theme of boundaries recurs, challenging conventional assumptions about the binary nature of things [@davison2017; quoted in @doloughan2019 222].

The most dramatic boundary disrupted occurs in the first section, in which the viewpoint character has died and is now reflecting on her own death. This is a very clear boundary, perhaps the most fundamental of all, that between life and death, but for Smith the boundary is not an absolute or a permanent one. Sara, the young woman in question, has died, but while this is an irrevocable state she is still able to think, feel, perceive the world, and even to interact with it, appearing to her close family to varying effect.

Smith's afterlife is nevertheless unusual in its nature. Unlike the assumed reality that death is both permanent and absolute, and yet also unlike the common fantasy trope that a ghost may remain for some period of time due to 'unfinished business' in full possession of their faculties but merely incorporeal, Sara's ghost has remained behind after death but gradually loses her faculties — forgetting common words, finding it more difficult to perceive the world or to make herself perceived by the living. Death, for Smith, is not a binary state but perhaps a spectrum; one becomes increasingly more dead over time.

Smith also introduces another unusual binary separation, between Sara's ghost, immaterial but still active in the world, and Sara's corpse, material but confined to her grave. While the ghost has forgotten much of what happened to her in life, her body seems to retain its own memories; the ghost wishes to remember, the body to forget. And while the ghost can perceive and interact with the world she appears to have a curious emotional distance from it, habitually referring to her living/former self in the third person, and her family members in the same distancing way; she is both drawn to them yet remains separate.
