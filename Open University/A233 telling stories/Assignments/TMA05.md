Works of fantasy have long included reflections of the real world to a greater or lesser extent. In works of science fiction that attempt to explore the impact of technical advances, authors such as Arthur C. Clarke painstakingly followed scientific laws in order to maintain verisimilitude. J.R.R. Tolkien, a professor of English and linguistics, applied linguistic rules to the development of languages in his fantasy writings. Ursula Le Guin spoke of her use of anthropology in her writing: to ‘hint at the complexity of the society’ [@wray2013] rather than present a more simplistic world.

Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess’ _Stardust_ [-@gaiman2019] begins in a recognisably real time and place. Dates are given, at least approximately, as are distances and directions to real-world place: the late 1830s, by reference to the accession of Queen Victoria, her first Prime Minister, and the publication of Charles Dickens’ _Oliver Twist_, among other things; and somewhere in the north of England, or perhaps Scotland, ‘a whole night’s drive’ from London to the south. Indeed, many works of realist fiction are similarly vague about their location in time and space; Hardy’s books are unquestionably set in the south-west of England during the 19th century, but the places he describes are fictional, though inspired by real ones, and cannot be dated more accurately than, perhaps, a given decade.

Yet _Stardust_ also deviates from realism just as soon as it begins to establish it: the second sentence of Chapter One is an ironic reference to genre convention, an acknowledgement that this is a story, rather than the more typically realist abstraction. Then, as the chapter progresses, it continues to combine fantasy and realism; as well as beginning to introduce the fantastic nature of the wall, the gateway, and the meadow beyond it, it also describes the village itself, its people, and in particular the way of life that has developed around the wall. It tries to present not merely a fantastical location, but a real place that is given no choice but to interact with a fantastical one.

Ursula Le Guin’s _The Dispossessed_ [-@leguin2002] also begins with a description of a wall, once again one which appears ordinary and yet, we are immediately told, has great significance despite this. Unlike Gaiman, Le Guin does not attempt to establish the location in time and space by reference to any other (though as the story progresses further details do provide reference points). However, to a greater extent than in _Stardust_, Le Guin provides detail of the setting that establishes it in a realist way. The descriptions start to give a sense of the place that will be explored further: both the ‘durable, grimy, and mournful’ dormitory building, and the tantalising reference to the ‘No Trespassing’ sign that, like the boundary wall, is the only one of its kind on the planet. As part of an _in medias res_ opening, it serves to draw the reader’s curiosity and give a sense of the world that is being left, as Shevek travels immediately to another, very different planet.

We are also given a sense of Shevek’s home after he has left it, while travelling on the spaceship, by the things he finds unusual, and what he does and does not take for granted: for example that ‘the water value did not cut off when you released the faucet, but kept pouring until shut off’ (p. 10), or the disposability of paper and clothing (p. 12–13). We begin to realise that he has lived under conditions that do not permit waste; indeed, the very phrase ‘it costs less’ has great significance to him. These descriptions of the setting therefore allow us to learn something significant about the character.

However, it is worth noting that these aspects of realism are not unique to either of these works but an inherent and necessary part of fantastical fiction. Many works of fantasy were intended as, or at least can be interpreted as, satire or social critique: not only _The Dispossessed_, for example, but perhaps also _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_ [@hahn2006 225; quoted in @brown2019b 140]. And even works which do not do so (or are not read in such a way) gain much of their power from their relation to reality; in Brown’s example of _The Lord of the Rings_, ‘The Shire is … a realistically described yet idealised landscape based on the English countryside’ [@brown2019 11], which allows the reader to relate to the characters in a very different way than if the home they set out from had been entirely unrecognisable.

_Stardust_ might be interpreted in this light. It does not have the same deeply philosophical and political intent as _The Dispossessed_ (though of course intent and effect are not the same thing). But locating its starting point in a recognisable English village brings with it cultural assumptions that shape how we read it; for example, we can imagine how Dunstan or Tristran might feel about their lot in life, or about the young women that each is infatuated by, and so on. As noted, _Stardust_ combines this familiar reality with an ironic awareness that the characters are on a quest
