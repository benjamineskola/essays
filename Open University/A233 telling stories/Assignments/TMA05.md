Works of fantasy have long included reflections of the real world to a greater or lesser extent. In works of science fiction that attempt to explore the impact of technical advances, authors such as Arthur C. Clarke painstakingly followed scientific laws in order to maintain verisimilitude. J.R.R. Tolkien, a professor of English and linguistics, applied linguistic rules to the development of languages in his fantasy writings. Ursula Le Guin spoke of her use of anthropology in her writing: to ‘hint at the complexity of the society’ [@wray2013] rather than present a more simplistic world.

Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess’ _Stardust_ [-@gaiman2019] begins in a recognisably real time and place. Dates are given, at least approximately, as are distances and directions to real-world place: the late 1830s, by reference to the accession of Queen Victoria, her first Prime Minister, and the publication of Charles Dickens’ _Oliver Twist_, among other things; and somewhere in the north of England, or perhaps Scotland, ‘a whole night’s drive’ from London to the south. Indeed, many works of realist fiction are similarly vague about their location in time and space; Hardy’s books are unquestionably set in the south-west of England during the 19th century, but the places he describes are fictional, though inspired by real ones, and cannot be dated more accurately than, perhaps, a given decade.

Yet _Stardust_ also deviates from realism just as soon as it begins to establish it: the second sentence of Chapter One is an ironic reference to genre convention, an acknowledgement that this is a story, rather than the more typically realist abstraction.
