title: Why does Popper think that observations cannot confirm a scientific theory? Is he right?
---

Over the course of a number of works, Karl Popper developed a theory of the scientific method building on the sceptical position of David Hume. Building on Hume’s argument, in the *Enquiry concerning Human Understanding*, that inductive reasoning was a rationally unjustifiable, yet necessary, basis for knowledge, Popper argued that the scientific method should not and need not rely on induction at all. This essay will first explore Popper’s argument against inductive reasoning, and then evaluate it against opposing viewpoints, including Hume and Kuhn.

Popper begins from a position of criticising the prevailing understanding of science as ‘proceed[ing] from observation to theory’, dating back to Francis Bacon.

He begins by criticising the possibility of ‘observation’ in the abstract. He suggests that a collection of ‘observations’ made without a specific purpose in mind would be worthless. ‘Observation is always selective.’ [@cottingham2008 457]. This seems to highlight a practical problem, at least, with the Baconian model of scientific enquiry; if observation precedes theorisation, then observation without a directed goal must be possible. Yet, in reality, the collection of every observable fact would be, at best, useless, being too large a quantity of data to usefully draw any conclusions from; moreover, it would almost certainly be shaped by preconceptions — different individuals would prioritise different observations. Observation is subsequent to theorisation, then: either confirming or refuting what was previously believed about the world.

Popper likewise rejects the importance of ‘confirmation’ or ‘verification’ of a theory: these are easy, he claims, to find; and an observation should only ‘count’ if it is ‘risky’. That is, there is a probabilistic element to the value of observation: if the theory tells us something which is aligned with our ‘unenlightened’ expectations, and this prediction is then confirmed to be true, we have learned nothing; a device which predicts the result of a random coin toss with 50 percent accuracy has no value greater than simply guessing the result.

A ‘good’ scientific theory, then, is one which ‘forbids certain things to happen’, and a test of the theory is an attempt to find a violation of this: to find an occurrence which would be forbidden by the theory and thus impossible if the theory were true.

He derives this reasoning from Hume. Hume rejects the validity of inductive reasoning as real proof of anything: “The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible; because it can never imply a contradiction” [in @chimisso2011 70]. So for Hume (and Popper finds this conclusive) no amount of observation can constitute an absolute proof: observing the existence of any number of black ravens does not disprove the existence of ravens which are not black. Only deductive reasoning can establish logically necessary conclusions, but deductive reasoning could not be based upon empirical observations.

Popper departs from Hume in the consequences of this, however. Hume establishes the unreliability of induction, but does not substitute an alternative basis for knowledge. Instead he proposes what Popper calls a ‘psychological theory’, by which human learning proceeds on the basis of experience and habit rather than logic. For Popper this is a failure; Hume, he thinks, has ‘not seriously considered’ the possibility that knowledge is actually not obtained by induction at all.

Popper’s answer, therefore, was to invert the process: rather than theory arising from observation, theory (or ‘conjecture’) preceded observation; observation should be an attempt to refute the conjecture.

Thus a theory ‘all ravens are black’, as mentioned, cannot be reliably proven through observation; observation cannot exclude the possibility that ravens of other colours exist but have escaped observation. But for Popper, the vital process is to attempt to *disprove* it. This refutation can be made deductively sound:

Observation: a problem Popper acknowledges but fails to solve.

Aligning verification with dogmatism, versus the critical–scientific attitude: is this rather a moral critique?

Hume: not strictly an objection since it predates, but has Popper actually disproved him? Perhaps his point is better made by Kuhn re: Popper not truly representing how people think.

Kuhn: not strictly related to the question of observation. But perhaps relevant in the deeper sense that Popper is wrong about how scientific theories progress.
