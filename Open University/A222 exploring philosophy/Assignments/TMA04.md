title: Why does Popper think that observations cannot confirm a scientific theory? Is he right?
---

Over the course of a number of works, Karl Popper developed a theory of the scientific method building on the sceptical position of David Hume. Building on Hume’s argument, in TODO, that inductive reasoning was a rationally unjustifiable, yet necessary, basis for knowledge, Popper argued that the scientific method should not and need not rely on induction at all. This essay will first explore Popper’s argument against inductive reasoning, and then evaluate it against opposing viewpoints, including Hume and Kuhn.

Popper begins from a position of criticising the prevailing understanding of science as ‘proceed[ing] from observation to theory’, dating back to Francis Bacon.

He begins by criticising the possibility of ‘observation’ in the abstract. He suggests that a collection of ‘observations’ made without a specific purpose in mind would be worthless. ‘Observation is always selective.’ [@cottingham2008 457]. This seems to highlight a practical problem, at least, with the Baconian model of scientific enquiry; if observation precedes theorisation, then observation without a directed goal must be possible. Yet, in reality, the collection of every observable fact would be, at best, useless, being too large a quantity of data to usefully draw any conclusions from; moreover, it would almost certainly be shaped by preconceptions — different individuals would prioritise different observations.

Popper likewise rejects the importance of ‘confirmation’ or ‘verification’ of a theory: these are easy, he claims, to find;

Observation: a problem Popper acknowledges but fails to solve.

Aligning verification with dogmatism, versus the critical–scientific attitude: is this rather a moral critique?

Hume: not strictly an objection since it predates, but has Popper actually disproved him? Perhaps his point is better made by Kuhn re: Popper not truly representing how people think.

Kuhn: not strictly related to the question of observation. But perhaps relevant in the deeper sense that Popper is wrong about how scientific theories progress.
