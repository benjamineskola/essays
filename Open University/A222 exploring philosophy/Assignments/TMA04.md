title: Why does Popper think that observations cannot confirm a scientific theory? Is he right?
---

Over the course of a number of works, Karl Popper developed a theory of the scientific method building on the sceptical position of David Hume. Building on Hume’s argument, in TODO, that inductive reasoning was a rationally unjustifiable, yet necessary, basis for knowledge, Popper argued that the scientific method should not and need not rely on induction at all. This essay will first explore Popper’s argument against inductive reasoning, and then evaluate it against opposing viewpoints, including Hume and Kuhn.



<!--

Hume: not strictly an objection since it predates, but has Popper actually disproved him? Perhaps his point is better made by Kuhn re: Popper not truly representing how people think.

Kuhn: not strictly related to the question of observation. But perhaps relevant in the deeper sense that Popper is wrong about how scientific theories progress.
