title: Are any of Hume’s objections to the argument from design decisive?
---

The teleological argument has been made in numerous forms dating back centuries, across multiple religions; Classical Greek philosophers made some form of it, and various Islamic theologians had argued both for and against it by the time Thomas Aquinas included it in _Summa Theologia_ in the 13th century. David Hume constructed a form of the argument as part of a dialogue in order to disprove it, but William Paley advanced a new version of it some decades later and it has remained a subject of debate through the 20th century and into the 21st. The question at hand is whether Hume’s objections were decisive; or, put another way: is it possible to formulate a teleological argument in such a way as to overcome Hume’s criticisms?

Hume’s first criticism, presented through the character of Philo, is directed at the form of argument by analogy:

> _… wherever you depart, in the least, from the similarity of the cases, you diminish proportionately the evidence …_
>  
> [Hume, in @cottingham2008 366]

Hume’s argument here, like his argument against miracles, is based on his empirical reasoning: that a connection between cause and effect cannot be proven, only inferred from repeated observation. An identical cause, repeated many times, can be safely presumed to have an identical effect, and by extension, a small variation in the cause might have a small variation in effect.

As applied to the creation of the world, the problem Hume identifies is that the similarity between (for example) a house, and the universe as a whole, is weak enough that the analogy is little more than a guess.

This is not a criticism that is limited to this particular formulation of the teleological argument, or even to the teleological argument in general, but rather to all arguments by analogy. As such, subsequent formulations are also vulnerable to it. Paley refined the argument, focusing only on certain aspects of nature and their ‘complexity, subtlety, and curiosity’ [@cottingham2008 365]. But he still depends on the premise that the universe is *sufficiently like* a created artefact to justify the comparison.

More recent versions of the teleological argument have focused on addressing the Darwinian challenge: aiming to prove that despite natural selection providing at least a partial explanation for complexity, it cannot provide a complete answer. For Behe, this complexity exists in aspects of biological life;  for Meyer, it is the chemical origins of life itself [both in @chappell2011]. However, these arguments depend on a similar form of conclusion: if it is proven that certain complex structures or systems cannot have occurred spontaneously or be explained by naturalistic explanations, then they are *like* human-created structures or systems and therefore their creator must be *like* humans. Therefore Hume’s objection still applies; and yet it is not an absolute disproof of Behe and Meyer, but only cause to be cautious.

The second part of Hume’s argument is the observation that complexity and order is not in itself proof of intelligence:

> For aught we can know *a priori*, matter may contain the source or spring of order originally within itself …
>  
> [Hume, in @cottingham2008 367]

This can be taken in multiple ways. It is an admission of ignorance or at least of agnosticism; Hume does not know all the answers, and refuses to draw strong conclusions based on the evidence available. As such, it cannot be a conclusive proof of Cleanthes’ 

Hume makes another point about Cleanthes’ form of the argument, which applies not only to Aquinas but to Paley and subsequent versions too, which is that it is not proven that the intelligent designer is in fact God [@chappell2011 64]. The fundamental form of the teleological argument is that the universe (or aspects of it) is too complex to have come about purely through chance, and that there must therefore be an intelligent creator of some form. However, this is not a sufficient argument for the existence of *God* — most if not all religions impute various attributes to their deity or deities beyond creation of the universe and everything in it. If it were proven that the universe must have an intelligent creator, it would not be proven that this creator is fundamentally benevolent, as for example Christianity holds; nor even would it prove that the same entity was responsible for creating the universe *and* life, for example.

This is, once again, not conclusive, as the teleological argument need not stand on its own. If the existence of an intelligent creator is proven, other arguments can be made to prove or disprove the creator’s benevolence, involvement with the world, and so on. Hume has not proven the non-existence of God, but he has shown the limits of the proof that could be established by this argument.

In short, Hume provides a number of objections to the teleological argument in the *Dialogues concerning Natural Religion*. If by conclusive we mean that Hume proved intelligent design to be self-contradictory or otherwise logically impossible, then it cannot be said that he succeeded. He brings the argument into serious doubt, while leaving open the possibility that it is in fact correct. Indeed, he seems to concede that the creator of the universe is somehow analogous to human intelligence [in @chappell2011 65]; he is just unconvinced by the arguments made to that effect. And yet on the other hand Hume’s objections, while not outright conclusive, are particularly persistent; several centuries later, arguments for an intelligent designer are still being made and still failing to overcome Hume’s critique.
