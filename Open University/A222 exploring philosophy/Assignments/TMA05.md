title: Is the functionalist account of pain plausible?
---

The functionalist theory of mind attempts to formulate a consistent, materialist explanation of the nature of the mind, and relationship between mind and body, addressing some criticisms levelled against other materialist theories, but leaving others potentially in question. This essay will argue that the functionalist account of pain is plausible (which I take to mean valid and coherent) but fails to be entirely persuasive, leaving gaps which remain to be explained by some other theory.
