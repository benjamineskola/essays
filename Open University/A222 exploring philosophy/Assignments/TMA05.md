title: Is the functionalist account of pain plausible?
---

The functionalist theory of mind attempts to formulate a consistent, materialist explanation of the nature of the mind, and relationship between mind and body, addressing some criticisms levelled against other materialist theories, but leaving others potentially in question. This essay will argue that the functionalist account of pain is plausible (which I take to mean valid and coherent) but fails to be entirely persuasive, leaving gaps which remain to be explained by some other theory.

A simple form of a materialist theory of mind posits that mental states are exactly equivalent to physical states — that is, that thoughts, sensations, and emotions correspond to particular characteristic patterns of neural activity. In turn, this has been criticised for failing to explain corresponding mental states in potentially very different physical forms — the multiple-realisation objection. In short, when a human experiences pain, this is equivalent to a particular physical brain state; but a non-human being may have a brain very different to a human brain, yet experience something clearly identifiable as pain. The naïve functionalist account seems to imply that if a being’s brain is sufficiently different from humans, none of their feelings can be meaningfully considered to be the same as any human feelings, even if by any ordinary definition of those feelings they are the same. It doesn’t appear to conform with our common sense; what we mean by ‘pain’ seems to be something more about how an individual behaves in certain circumstances, not what precise kind of neural activity they display.
