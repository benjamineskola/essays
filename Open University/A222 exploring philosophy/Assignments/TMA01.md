## Part A

1. The phrase ‘personal identity’ in this philosophical context refers to the state of being a single person, rather than multiple persons, and the question of what it is that makes a given person be considered to be separate (or not) from another person.

2. For Locke, ‘man’ refers to a given human being, their material form as might be perceived by others, without reference to any immaterial consciousness or soul.

3. Locke distinguishes a ‘person’ from a ‘man’ by the concept of continuing consciousness (including memory). A given individual may be the same _man_ at two different times, but having lost all memory of the earlier time would no longer be the same _person_ [@cottingham2008 279, para. 3]. Conversely, having the consciousness and memories of a particular person implies being the same person, having the same identity; the material form inhabited by that consciousness is irrelevant (p. 278, para. 2).

4. Thought experiments can help clarify a concept by identifying which factors of a given situation are relevant to the question at hand; we might find that we give different answers to the question when applied to different situations, and thus have to examine the differences between those situations to determine whether they matter (and might undermine the hypothesis being tested), or whether the differing answers come from preconceptions.

   For example, in the three thought experiments from Locke presented in the textbook [@warburton2011 20-22], Locke’s argument remains consistent: that it is consciousness/memory that defines personhood. Yet reading them, we might consider that it makes no sense to consider someone literally a different person when they are drunk as when they are sober, and that Locke’s argument is therefore wrong. We must then either identify the relevant difference in this situation (perhaps we could make an argument that someone is morally responsible for their own drunkenness and therefore for acts committed while drunk) or otherwise accept that our preconceptions were wrong.

## Part B

For Locke, to understand the nature of personal identity it is necessary to understand what a person is, which he decides is ‘a thinking intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing in different times and places’ [@cottingham2008 275]. He then goes on to differentiate this from other possible conceptions of personhood and to emphasise the importance of this self-consciousness as the key factor.

Neither bodily continuity nor continuity of the soul is sufficient, or indeed necessary. He insists on the distinction between ‘man’ and ‘person’, where a single living human body would constitute ‘the same man’ from birth to death but not necessarily the same person. He argues that if the same consciousness was transferred into a different body, it would nevertheless constitute the same person; and that a particular human (or ‘man’) may, at some point in their life, not be the same person as at other points in their life. He illustrates this both with fantastical hypotheticals (a prince and a cobbler swapping bodies, a single body inhabited by multiple alternating minds) but also more practical examples: of drunkenness and mental illness or mere forgetfulness, which ‘is reflected in common speech when we say that someone is “not himself”…’ (ibid., p. 279).

Nor does the nature of the soul determine personal identity; an individual living today may have the same soul as one living centuries ago (‘at the siege of Troy’, for example); but without any memories of that past life, the present individual cannot possible consider themself as being the same person as the past individual and be concerned with their actions in a personal sense, no more than being made up of some of the same matter would.

This has some implications that are perhaps more difficult to accept, and have led to criticism. Locke insists that someone cannot be the same person as another if they have no consciousness or memory of the other’s life and actions; and this is uncontroversial when applied to the question of whether the Mayor of Quinborough is the same person as Socrates.[^1] Yet in the case of forgetfulness or drunkenness, he equally insists on the absolute non-identity of personality.

The problem here seems to lie on several levels. We might say that _obviously_ someone is still the same person whether drunk or sober; but anticipating this, Locke argues that this is merely imprecise use of language, that they are the same ‘man’ but not the same person. And while he argues that it would be unjust to punish someone for acts they do not remember (just as it would be unjust to punish an identical twin for the acts of their sibling), he also notes that humans cannot ever be sure that the forgetfulness is real and not simply an excuse, and thus that a court of law will hold someone responsible for those acts[^2], but that on the Day of Judgment, God will be able to determine whether the forgetfulness is real or feigned.

However, Thomas Reid argued that the problem with Locke’s treatment of memory goes beyond simple impracticality into contradiction [@warburton2011 43–46]. Reid noted that memory and forgetfulness are not absolutes, lost or retained in large blocks; someone may have forgotten something, but remember a time when they had not yet forgotten it. If a young man remembers his childhood, then he and that child are, in Locke’s terms, the same person; if, as an old man, he has forgotten his childhood, he is no longer that person. Yet if as an old man he remembers being a young man, he is then still the same person as that young man; yet the young man _is_ the boy, while the old man _is not_; as Reid says, he ‘is, and at the same time is not, the same person with \[that child]’.

In essence, Reid interprets identity as a transitive relation — as indeed it is in a mathematical sense. (If $x = y$ and $y = z$ then by necessity $x = z$.) Yet this might be a false analogy; Locke does not claim that personal identity behaves as mathematical identity does, and while a non-transitive identity may seem counterintuitive, it would not be inherently contradictory; Reid’s critique is therefore based upon mere assumption that the identity-relation has this property (p. 45).

A further objection, raised by Warburton and citing Paul Snowdon (p. 46) is that, while not logically contradictory, Locke’s conception of identity as memory-based is simply impractical — it does not account for the way in which memory really works. As Reid rightly identified, in most cases, people do not wake up one day having forgotten everything before a particular point in time, having previously remembered everything; rather, they forget some things and not others. An account of identity that bears so little relation to the practical experience of existence does not seem especially useful. Not only this, but it fails to account for the ways in which past experience may shape one’s present self even if the conscious mind has forgotten it; Reid’s old man may not remember his childhood, but his childhood experiences will have had an influence on his adult life nevertheless — can they really be said not to be a part of one’s self? The alternative conception mentioned by Warburton and Snowdon, that of multiple ‘overlapping’ memory-selves, might be suitable as a way of adapting Locke, amending his concept rather than abandoning it out right.

Moreover, Locke’s idea of moral responsibility for an act seems curiously disjointed. On the one hand, he insists that a person cannot be held morally responsible for an action they do not remember taking; this perspective might well be accommodated by modern theories of punishment centring on rehabilitation. (Mackie’s reading, in @warburton2011, pp. 110–114, might point in that direction.) Yet, as noted above, he also considered that the appropriate thing was to punish someone anyway (in effect, that the punishment adhered to the ‘man’, not the person per se), this being all that human understanding could be expected to cope with; true justice was to be found in the afterlife, based on divine wisdom. As a guide to moral action, then, Locke’s conception of the self seems lacking.

Overall, while aspects of Locke’s argument may seem at odds with modern thinking, these are not fatal flaws so much as cultural differences. It is Reid’s criticism that is most challenging, and which requires some sort of departure from Locke’s writing to address.

[^1]: Generously, Locke appears to accept the possibility that the Mayor is indeed Socrates, assuming this condition is met.
[^2]: This is not the reasoning a court would use nowadays, though it may have been in the 17th century.
