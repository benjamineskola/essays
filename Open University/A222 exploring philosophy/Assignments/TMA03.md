title: Critically compare act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism.

Utilitarian ethical theories were originally propounded by Jeremy Bentham in *An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation* and John Stuart Mill in *Utilitarianism*. Both authors would have agreed on the basic principle of utilitarianism, formulated by Mill as “actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness”. However, they and subsequent utilitarians have disagreed on various other aspects, including how best to quantify and compare the happiness promoted by a given action and indeed the nature of happiness itself.
