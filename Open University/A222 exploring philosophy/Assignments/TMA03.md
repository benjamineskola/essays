title: Critically compare act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism.

Utilitarian ethical theories were originally propounded by Jeremy Bentham in *An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation* and John Stuart Mill in *Utilitarianism*. Both authors would have agreed on the basic principle of utilitarianism, formulated by Mill as “actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness”. However, they and subsequent utilitarians have disagreed on various other aspects, including how best to quantify and compare the happiness promoted by a given action and indeed the nature of happiness itself.

Bentham’s version of the theory has been characterised as ‘crude’, in which view Mill’s version is seen as a refinement or improvement [@barber2011 50]. However, the changes Mill proposes are significant enough to constitute an entirely distinct theory, requiring separate justification.

For Bentham, an ethical action is one whose ‘tendency it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any it has to diminish it’ [@barber2011 183]. It seems to be implied, and has been criticised on the basis, that each individual act must be evaluated in its own right. Mill, then, addresses this, with the theoretical innovation that later came to be referred to as ‘rule’ utilitarianism;
