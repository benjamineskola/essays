title: Critically compare act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism.
---

Utilitarian ethical theories were originally propounded by Jeremy Bentham in *An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation* and John Stuart Mill in *Utilitarianism*. Both authors would have agreed on the basic principle of utilitarianism, formulated by Mill as “actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness”. However, they and subsequent utilitarians have disagreed on various other aspects, including how best to quantify and compare the happiness promoted by a given action and indeed the nature of happiness itself.

Bentham’s version of the theory has been characterised as ‘crude’, in which view Mill’s version is seen as a refinement or improvement [@barber2011 50]. However, the changes Mill proposes are significant enough to constitute an entirely distinct theory, requiring separate justification.

For Bentham, an ethical action is one whose ‘tendency it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any it has to diminish it’ [@barber2011 183]. It seems to be implied, and has been criticised on the basis, that each individual act must be evaluated in its own right. Mill, then, addresses this, with the theoretical innovation that later came to be referred to as ‘rule’ utilitarianism; he observes that the end goal of maximising utility does not preclude other ‘secondary’ principles to that effect, and that therefore there is no need ‘to endeavour to test each individual action by the first principle’ [@cottingham2008 517].

Mill, however, does not outright suggest ‘rule’ utilitarianism in any strong sense, and indeed is inconsistent on the matter [@barber2011 80]. Instead it seems that he intended ethical rules as a kind of heuristic, ‘signposts’ towards the final ethical outcome, and that utilitarianism would be no different from other ethical systems in that way.

Later utilitarians (and other consequentialists[^1]) formalised versions of the theory based on rules, conceiving of moral actions as being those that are in keeping with rules that would bring about the greatest happiness for the greatest number.

[^1]: “After the middle of the 20th Century it has become more common to identify as a ‘Consequentialist’ since very few philosophers agree entirely with the view proposed by the Classical Utilitarians, particularly with respect to the hedonistic value theory.” [@sep2014] As the rule/act distinction applies to the consequentialist aspect of utilitarianism I have made reference to these in this essay.
