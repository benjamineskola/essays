title: Critically compare act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism.
---

Utilitarian ethical theories were originally propounded by Jeremy Bentham in *An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation* and John Stuart Mill in *Utilitarianism*. Both authors would have agreed on the basic principle of utilitarianism, formulated by Mill as “actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness”. However, they and subsequent utilitarians have disagreed on various other aspects, including how best to quantify and compare the happiness promoted by a given action and indeed the nature of happiness itself.

Bentham’s version of the theory has been characterised as ‘crude’, in which view Mill’s version is seen as a refinement or improvement [@barber2011 50]. However, the changes Mill proposes are significant enough that subsequent authors have developed them into what is in effect an entirely distinct subtheory, requiring separate justification.

For Bentham, an ethical action is one whose ‘tendency it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any it has to diminish it’ [@barber2011 183]. It seems to be implied, and has been criticised on the basis, that each individual act must be evaluated in its own right. Mill, then, addresses this, with the theoretical innovation that later came to be referred to as ‘rule’ utilitarianism; he observes that the end goal of maximising utility does not preclude other ‘secondary’ principles to that effect, and that therefore there is no need ‘to endeavour to test each individual action by the first principle’ [@cottingham2008 517].

Mill, however, does not outright suggest ‘rule’ utilitarianism in any strong sense, and indeed is inconsistent on the matter [@barber2011 80]. Instead it seems that he intended ethical rules as a kind of heuristic, ‘signposts’ towards the final ethical outcome, and that utilitarianism would be no different from other ethical systems in that way. Subsequent act utilitarians have tended to agree with Mill either explicitly or implicitly, ‘nearly never’ arguing that the utility of each act must be calculated individually when making a decision [@hooker2015].

Later utilitarians (and other consequentialists[^conseq]) formalised versions of the theory based on rules, conceiving of moral actions as being those that are in keeping with rules that would bring about the greatest happiness for the greatest number. These attempt to address seemingly counterintuitive outcomes from act utilitarianism. An act utilitarian might, for example, justify theft or murder so long as it produces more overall utility. For example, if there were several transplant patients requiring a donor of a rare blood type, act utilitarianism suggests that killing a healthy person in order to harvest their organs would be the moral thing to do [quoted in @sinnott-armstrong2019].

[^conseq]: “After the middle of the 20th Century it has become more common to identify as a ‘Consequentialist’ since very few philosophers agree entirely with the view proposed by the Classical Utilitarians, particularly with respect to the hedonistic value theory.” [@driver2014] As the act/rule distinction applies to the consequentialist aspect of utilitarianism I have made reference to these in this essay.

Rule utilitarianism is not the only solution to these counterintuitive cases. A distinction might be drawn between action and inaction: between murdering someone and allowing them to die [@sinnott-armstrong2019]. This indeed is in keeping with common ethical intuition, but it does not appear to be justifiable by reference to the principle of utility: *why*, given an otherwise identical amount of utility (equal number of deaths, etc.) should murder be worse? This in turn has further implications; should a utilitarian oppose euthanasia, for example? Attempts to reconcile these objections turn act utilitarianism into a much more complicated theory than the simple statement of principle would suggest.

Rule utilitarianism then proposes that the bearer of utility is a rule or set of rules; that a society in which this or that rule is accepted and obeyed is one with greater overall utility than one without. Thus for example a rule can be formulated along the lines of “it is forbidden to actively end somebody’s life”, which does not have to reckon with the possibility that in certain situations it is possible for killing to produce greater utility than not-killing. The transplant example is therefore solved in a way that would match with most people’s intuitions: that killing an innocent person even to save the lives of others is forbidden.

It may of course still be necessary to adjust these rules to account for varying circumstances; for example, a proviso regarding consent could be made in order to treat euthanasia as different from murder. However, while for act utilitarianism such provisos would have to be made to the general principle (“the greatest good for the greatest number unless it means killing an innocent person”, perhaps, to account for the transplant example), in rule utilitarianism the principle remains unamended and each specific rule (or set of rules) remains consistent with that principle (“it is forbidden to actively end somebody’s life without their consent”, perhaps, to permit euthanasia).

However, rule utilitarianism is not without its potential complexities. The question remains to be resolved of the conditions under which a given rule might increase utility: compliance with said rule, or acceptance of it [@hooker2015]. This is not a purely semantic distinction; while it is, of course, compliance with a rule that produces the most obvious and direct effect, ‘acceptance of a rule can have consequences other than compliance’ (ibid.). For example, obedience to a rule that forbids lying will, of course, prevent lying; but acceptance of the rule may well be found to increase trust and thereby make people happier, even prior to any situation in which the rule could be complied with or broken. 

Basing the moral judgment on the acceptance rather than obedience of a rule also produces more intuitive answers in cases where it may be acceptable either to act or not to act: under obedience-rule utilitarianism, a rule “have some children”, if universally violated, would lead to extinction, yet it is difficult to argue that failing to have children is immoral; acceptance-rule utilitarianism allows for acts that are permissible due to violating no accepted rule [@sinnott-armstrong2019].

A further point of contention is what it means for a rule to be ‘accepted’, however; various authors have differed on whether this means to be integrated into individuals’ consciences, for example, or ‘built into public institutions’ [@sinnott-armstrong2019].

Thus, while earlier it was noted that act utilitarianism may result in counterintuitive decisions unless further complexity is introduced to its basic principle, rule utilitarianism requires more complexity in the statement of its basic principle in order to be meaningful in the first place, but as a result is able to adjust more flexibly to moral quandaries.
