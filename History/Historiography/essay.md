## Background of the Author

The author is and was a professor of history at a university in Dallas, specializing in modern British history; a reviewer notes little in the way of previous work on the Spanish Civil War or the twentieth century generally [@stradling2000], and his CV confirms that most of his previous research, including his only previous book, have involved the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. There seems to be no strong indication of a historiographical movement in this work; however, a clear political inclination comes across, in the form of an aversion to Communism.

## Other Historians

One major work on the Spanish Civil War in general terms (including, as a major component, the International Brigades) is @thomas1961. It looks at the subject more broadly than Hopkins’ book, and thus lacks the detail that Hopkins’ has. As a result of its relatively early publication date (at the height of the Cold War), it had access only to a relatively limited set of archives.

A more recent work is @beevor2006. As this was written after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it, like Hopkins’ book, has been able to make use of the Russian archives that relate to the topic, unlike Thomas’ book; like Thomas’s book, it looks at the war as a whole rather than the specific contribution of the British volunteers.

Another book focussing more specifically on the British involvement in the Spanish Civil War is @baxell2012. Like Hopkins’ work it attempts to place the war in the context of British society and culture of the 1930s; however, it differs from Hopkins’ book in paying greater attention to the war itself, rather than simply its intellectual influence.

## Sources

The book uses a wide range of sources, including the Public Record Office (now the National Archives) in London; the International Brigade Archives at Manchester Metropolitan University, the Marx Memorial Library, and Brandeis University in Massachusetts; as well as a range of individual collections held at other universities and collections. Of particular significance, however, is the use of the International Brigade Collection at the Russian Center for the Preservation and Study of Recent Historical Documents in Moscow, which had only recently become available when the book was written.

As a work of intellectual history, there is also a wide range of secondary sources used — from other historical works on the Spanish Civil War, to more general histories like _The Oxford History of Britain_ and E.P. Thompson’s _The Making of the English Working Class_, to contemporary works of fiction and non-fiction like the essays of Virginia Woolf and Jack London’s _The People of the Abyss_.

## Causes

The work pays little attention to the causes of the conflict per se, being more concerned with the intellectual context than political or military matters; however, it does investigate the relationship between the British volunteers and Stalinist Russia (ostensibly an ally and patron) and the effects of this relationship on the volunteers’ experience of the war, particular in terms of censorship and discipline. The relationship is seen as one ultimately of exploitation and betrayal of the volunteers by the Soviet Union (or “international Communism”).

## Quantitative Analysis

The book contains little in the way of quantitative analysis; there are no tables or organized statistics, and one reviewer notes the surprising lack of attention paid to the death/casualty rate [@frank1999].

## Reviews

The first reviewer [@frank1999] firstly notes that the author views the Soviet relationship to the International Brigades as being one of “oppressive control”, and is therefore critical of the work’s failure to look at the wider political context of the relationship between the Soviet Union and the West in the 1930s (a period of heightened tensions with Nazi Germany from both East and West). He notes that the major contribution of the work is its investigation of “motive, attitude, and thought” and the way this affected the relationship between working-class and middle-class volunteers, from the highly-divided Britain of the 1930s, as they came to work together for a common cause, and the divisions that remained between them.

The second [@stradling2000] identifies the author’s sympathies as being with the British Battalion itself, and emphatically not with its ostensible ally and patron, the Soviet Union; he argues that the work has a metanarrative of “a triumph of the British working class itself”. He is critical of the lack of attention paid to the military aspects of the conflict (perhaps an unfair criticism of what is largely an intellectual history), and of the omission of most (if not all) Spanish archives.

The third [@nelson2004] also notes the author’s “rare” combination of anti-communist politics and sympathy and respect for the individual volunteers; a theme of the work is thus the contradiction between these two aspects, which the author presents as a betrayal of the volunteers by the Soviet hierarchy. The working-class culture of the Brigades is discussed in detail; however, the reviewer takes issue with the author’s interpretation of the Soviet influence on that culture, believing it to be overstated and inclined to take negative statements by volunteers at face value rather than as an expression of the difficult conditions they faced.

## Meaning

The Spanish Civil War played a significant part in the build-up to the Second World War, in its conflict between Fascism and the Popular Front of Socialists and Liberals. As such it was important on a political (and military) level. However, this book finds a deeper significance, in the social and cultural makeup of 1930s Britain — an industrial country still recovering from the Great Depression — and the bridges that could be built between the working-class and middle-class volunteers in the International Brigades.
