The nature of the ‘fall’ of the Roman Empire has long been a matter of dispute. On one hand, the fall of Rome is often associated with the sacks of Rome in 410 and 455 or the deposition of the last Western Emperor in 476. On the other hand, Gibbon’s “History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” begins in the first century AD and ends with the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Empire in 1453. While there are few more recent historians who would go so far, it is safe to say that the matter is not entirely settled. There are a number of issues that must be discussed in relation to this question. Firstly, one of geography: one can feasibly argue that the Western Empire fell in 476, but it would be significantly more difficult to argue that the Eastern Empire did. Even the two halves of the empire are not homogeneous; each province can be studied on an individual basis, and in each case the answer will be somewhat different. Secondly, one of methodology; looking solely at literary sources gives a very different answer to looking at archaeological sources. Furthermore, studying, for example, the economic history will give a different answer to studying the cultural or religious history; these, too, are influenced by geography. It is only by looking at each of these aspects and integrating the various findings that the question can be answered.

One difficulty in arguing that the Roman Empire ‘fell’ is the lack of any single event which might constitute a fall [@innes2007]. For example, if the Western Empire is held to have ended in 476 with the deposition of Romulus Augustulus and the establishment of Odoacer’s kingdom, one must also take into account that Odoacer was made Duke of Italy by the Eastern Emperor; this “barbarian kingdom” was nominally still part of the Empire; Rome and Ravenna in particular were reconquered by Justinian less than a century later, and remained part of the Empire for a further two centuries.

The situation in the provinces of the Western Empire was somewhat different. Many “effectively seceded” in the years leading up to Alaric’s sack of Rome in 410, and unlike the Italian territories few were ever reclaimed (the exceptions being parts of Africa and the Spanish coast). However, the situation here can still be more properly characterised as a gradual decline than a sudden fall; ‘barbarian’ influence grew over a period of decades, and the focus of society slowly shifted away from Rome.

Beyond this, changes occurred over the period of the fourth and fifth centuries, across both halves of the empire, in the relationship between cities and provinces. The elite class that had previously focused around the cities, increasingly moved to provincial estates [@lee2013; @loseby2009]. The previously relatively autonomous city administrations had become, from the time of Diocletian in particular, increasingly centralised and under the sway of the Imperial bureaucracy. With the decrease in opportunities for personal enrichment that this caused came a migration away from the cities. Thus, in many cases there was a decline in civic life, particularly in the west. On the other hand, recent archaeological evidence has suggested that in a number of Anatolian cities, for example, there was significant growth, not decline.

At the same time as city elites were relocating to provincial estates, the west was becoming increasingly militarised and by extension ‘barbarianised’ [@innes2007]. The ever-growing threat of barbarian incursions, combined with the growing use of barbarian groups in the Roman Army, meant there was a significant power structure in the Western Empire with less loyalty to the Imperial government than had been normal in the past. It had become the norm for the emperor to leave military business to the ‘master of soldiers’, in contrast with Constantine’s time, where one of the emperor’s roles (perhaps the most important) was to lead the armies. The emperors became part of the civilian elites, focussing their efforts on retaining their footing in the Italian heartlands and allowing a power vacuum to develop in the provinces further afield, a vacuum that was filled by the military elites.

In certain contexts, it is even more difficult to argue for a fall. For example, it has been shown that trade continued across many parts of the empire (or former empire) [@wickham2005]. Pottery produced in North Africa across a wide timespan has been found in many other regions with trade connections. In particular, dating examples of this pottery (African Red Slipware, or ARS) demonstrates that there was no interruption in trade as the imperial structure itself fell. In the case of Great Britain, the earliest examples of ARS are dated to after the end of the Western Empire, suggesting that trade not only did not decline but perhaps increased. It can thus be argued that it is more appropriate to speak of a ‘transformation’ than a ‘decline’, as although change undoubtedly occurred it is not always clear that such change was negative.

Looking further at civic life shows other significant changes that cannot however be described as a decline. For example, the focus of public life shifted somewhat over the centuries, as Christianity spread [@lee2013]. Previously, city elites had tended to demonstrate their wealth and influence by funding the construction of temples and other important public edifices. Growing Christian influence meant that these pagan symbols were increasingly neglected, but far from declining into barbarism, the elite class merely redirected their resources towards the building of churches. In other cases, the public buildings were themselves repurposed as Christian churches [@loseby2009]. This Christianisation was exacerbated by Christian antipathy towards ‘pagan’ entertainments such as theatres and circuses, seen as immoral by figures such as Augustine [@lee2013].

The church itself grew steadily in power and influence in Europe throughout this time, with the importance of Rome returning as a result. Most of Europe south and west of the Danube was converted between the early fourth and late sixth century, supposedly a period of decline. This resurgance in importance of Rome came with increasing political power, to the point that Charlemagne, by then the ruler of one of the most influential states in Western Europe, was crowned as Emperor by the Pope.

In the context of transformation, it is useful to look at Rome’s successor states. Especially in provinces in the East that were lost to the growing Arab empire in the seventh century, there was little change in daily life. The Arab conquerers installed themselves as a new elite, placing themselves at the top of the existing power structure but allowing that structure to remain mostly unchanged; rather than taxes going to the Emperor in Constantinople, they went to the Arabs. No ‘decline’ occurred, for the people of these provinces, merely a change in rulers; the decline was felt only by the Imperial authorities [@lapidus2002; @innes2007].

In conclusion, while it may be reasonably argued that Rome declined, it is harder to make a case for a ‘fall’. Countless events and processes, over a period of centuries, led to the loss of its power and influence, particularly in the west and somewhat later in the east. However, there is no event that can be singled out as “the fall of the Roman Empire”, or even of one of its halves; rather, it is the combination of these countless changes, each on its own relatively minor, that constitute the decline. Often, even the idea of a decline is misleading, when for most of the Empire a transformation would be more accurate; though the central power of the Empire itself declined, it does not necessarily follow that the people of the Empire experienced a worsening of conditions, at least in the long term. Overall, the picture is one of fundamental changes, with the Roman Empire disappearing entirely in the west and somewhat more slowly in the east. However, outside the strictly political context of the power of the Empire itself, these changes not unambiguously negative, and the idea of a ‘transformation’ may be a more useful one.
