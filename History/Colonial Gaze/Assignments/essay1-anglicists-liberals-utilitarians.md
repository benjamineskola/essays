The beginnings of Orientalist knowledge of India as a distinct phenomenon date from the arrival of the Portuguese in the subcontinent at the end of the fifteenth century. The Liberal conception of India developed later, as part of the broader Enlightenment and the shift it entailed in the understanding of the world. Both mindsets were rooted in the social conditions in which they emerged, the former in the context of early-modern exploration and imperialism, the latter as a result of the increasing importance of Enlightenment ideologies in the transition to capitalism.

Prior to the Portuguese arrival, little knowledge of India was available to Western Europeans; the boundaries of the known world were, for practical purposes, the boundaries of Christendom. Across the Mediterranean were the Muslim empires, most recently and significantly the Ottomans. While periodically over the preceding four centuries crusades by Western Christians had established short-lived states in western Asia, these had for the most part disappeared; further, the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire had steadily lost territory until finally Constantinople itself was conquered in 1453. Thus there were two necessities perceived by Western Christianity in the second half of the fifteenth century. Firstly, to extend the frontiers of Christianity, based on a perception of ‘rightful’ territories that had been lost; this process was completed in Iberia with the fall of Granada and the end of the reconquista in 1492. This desire to expand Christendom developed into a missionary tendency, to spread the Gospel not by military force on the frontiers of Europe (after 1492, Christian states within Europe were primarily on the defensive, with few offensive victories until the modern period) but by education and conversion particularly in the world beyond the Islamic empires. Secondly, the more prosaic commercial drive, to find new trade routes that would not be blocked and taxed by the Ottomans. This drive also coincided with the development during the fifteenth century, particularly by the Portuguese, of maritime technologies such as the caravel and carrack that would allow longer and more arduous ocean journeys possible (where previously they had been limited mostly to coastal journeys).

Orientalist knowledge was therefore dominated in the early stages by the Jesuit missionaries who established themselves in India, as well as later in China and Japan. Thus their acquisition of knowledge was influenced both by their religious goals and the preconceptions that their Catholic ethos gave them. Conversely, later British interactions were expressly prohibited from pursuing religious goals by the terms of the East India Company’s charter. The developing systems of knowledge were thus more clearly influenced by the developing ideas of the Enlightenment, particularly Scottish thinkers like James Mill [@metcalf1994].

It is important to note, however, that even among the enlightenment thinkers, attitudes varied. A particular example can be seen in the French enlightenment during the eighteenth century, where for example Voltaire said of China that European princes should “ ire and blush, but above all imitate…”, while his contemporary Montesquieu was central to the development of the concept of ‘oriental despotism’, using China as an example of tyranny and corruption [@hung2003]. Hung connects this division to attitudes towards European social structures, describing “the Sinophiles as the spokesmen of the absolutist state and the Sinophobes as spokesmen of the bourgeoisie or the aristocracy”, and further drawing the connection between these attitudes and the development and spread of capitalism within Europe.

Thus a parallel can be drawn with British attitudes towards India in the eighteenth century and onwards: absolute monarchy had been discredited in the British psyche during the seventeenth century, particularly by the civil wars under Charles I in the 1640s but additionally by the reign of James II in 1685–88, whose abdication had led to the entrenchment of Parliamentary sovereignty and the formal limitation of monarchical power. It can be noted, too, that both of these conflicts associated absolutism with Catholicism (Charles, though Protestant, had been seen as overly sympathetic towards Catholicism, while James’ unpopularity had been a result of his open Catholicism and Catholic heir). Thus the dominant attitude by the time Britain began to consolidate its rule in India was one which saw Britain (or rather, perhaps, British people) as being uniquely free, and Asia in general and India in particular as being fundamentally despotic; indeed, this view of India was operationalized in the justification of the conquest of India (necessary, it was suggested, to protect British interests from despotism) [@travers2007].

Mill’s History of British India (written, not unusually, without any first-hand experience of India) expressed the developing liberal attitude more explicitly, using a schema of civilizational stages common to the Scottish Enlightenment of which he was part; by this schema, India had made “but a few of the earliest steps on the road to civilization”. This judgement was based in Bentham’s criterion of “utility”, which is to say the extent to which a society or government maximized happiness or well-being. Mill further held that liberty was not an end unto itself but merely a means for producing utility when threatened by the potential of tyranny; it was thus necessary in Britain, but not in India. While his son, John Stuart Mill, argued conversely that liberty was indeed valuable in its own right, he nevertheless found justifications in his various works for withholding freedom from those not yet ready for it. (Metcalf, 1994, pp.30–31)

The younger Mill’s position on the governance of India revolved particularly around the concept of “improvement”, arguing that despotism was justified “provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end” [@mill2009]. This conception of improvement was, as Metcalf describes, the foundation of experimentation in state social policy, for example in education and bureaucracy. It was further supported by the conception of India as “static” and incapable of developing itself, thus imposing on the English a moral duty to spread their civilization. Metcalf calls this a “radical universalism”, a conception that English culture (“civilization”) was intrinsically and universally superior and that transforming other cultures into the Western image would be unquestionably to the benefit of all.

This required also a process of “othering”, of conceptualizing Indians and Indian society not only as intrinsically different from but often precisely opposite to the English. Where England was the home of “ancient liberties”, India must necessarily have been home to a deep-rooted tyranny; where England was increasingly leading the world in technological advances, India was timeless, stuck in the past. A similar process of bothering can be seen in the writings of Jesuit missionaries, who characterized Indians, and particularly Brahmins, as “perverse and wicked”, “liars and cheats”, ignorant and lacking in education; Hindu religious practices were equated with devil worship or simply dismissed as fraudulent [@xavier1543]. This again reflects the values held by the Jesuits: as Christians they saw themselves as virtuous and educated, and they represented non-Christians as meeting none of these standards in order to emphasize their own superiority. For the Jesuits, in particular, education and Christian faith became conflated, so that becoming literate and educated in secular matters was inseparable from knowledge of Christianity and acceptance of Christian doctrine; this can be seen in Xavier’s writings, for example, in which the only educated Brahmins are those who begin to show an interest in Christianity.

Education also was a significant factor for the liberal imperialists of later centuries, who conceived of a process of creating “black Englishmen” through enlightened education [@macaulay1835]. Naturally, this was to be education on those subjects valued by the English; indeed, Macaulay explicitly dismissed the notion that study of Indian literature might have value, even alongside European literature, and discounted any value of teaching of or in languages other than English. While it was acknowledged that “Arabic and Sanscrit” had some lingering value, it was more desirable to continue the civilizing mission further, to produce a new code of laws that would make the existing texts obsolete. In this way, the civilizing mission was self-justifying: the more that was done to bring English civilization to Indians, the more necessary and practical it became to continue.

This stands in opposition to the Jesuit methodology, which proceeded by learning the native languages and producing religious materials in those languages as a method for extending the reach of Christianity. It also differed from the attitude of earlier British scholars, such as Jones and Dow, who did not go so far as Macaulay in dismissing the value of Indian languages and culture. For Jones in particular, the study of the Indian language provided knowledge of the origins of European culture, connecting not only the Indo-European languages but also their religions. In this sense, the study of India was still primarily justified by its value to Europeans and for their knowledge of themselves, but this did not become the outright rejection and dismissal that characterized the later liberals.
