title: Why did the Weimar republic collapse?
---

The period of the Weimar Republic was one of great turmoil in a number of spheres, both for Germany and for the wider world. The end of the Great War led to deep social unrest, from the revolution of 1918–19 through to the end of the Weimar period. This in turn contributed to political instability, compounded by the balkanisation of the Reichstag and the flawed Weimar constitution. All of this was exacerbated by economic hardship, particularly at the beginning and end of the period and influenced by external factors, not least the Wall Street Crash and Great Depression that followed. All of these factors contributed to the rise of the NSDAP and the collapse of the Weimar government. However, despite the obvious importance of the NSDAP in later years, the collapse would have taken place anyway; rather than being a significant contributing factor, it was merely in the right place at the right time to take advantage of the collapse.

Germany, like much of Europe, faced social unrest at the end of the war, rising initially out of the disruption of the war itself and exacerbated by the German losses and eventual defeat [@bessel1997]. This unrest began with mutiny in the German military and was shortly followed by the abdication of the Kaiser and declaration of a republic, followed by months of civil war and the eventual adoption of the ‘Weimar’ Constitution. However, the tensions did not disappear with the end of the civil war. The leftist SPD, already moving to the centre, suffered a schism over the policy of support for the republic, with the radical left wing of the party leaving to form the German Communist Party (KPD). After the early stages of the Republic, the centrist parties (SDP, DDP, Zentrum) lost ground to the extremist parties, not recovering until later in the decade.

The tensions were exacerbated by a number of factors. The outcome of the war, in particular the punitive nature of the Treaty of Versailles, was deeply unpopular in Germany, not just with the far right but across the political spectrum [@bessel1997]. The territorial losses were seen as a ‘disfigurement’ and an insult to German national pride, the ‘war guilt’ clause as an affront [@roberts1989].

The immediate post-war years were marked by economic difficulties resulting from the conflict. These resulted firstly from the massive conversion of an economy dedicated to supporting the war effort back into a peacetime mode of production, and secondly from the many thousands of soldiers who lacked employment once demobilised. This led to widespread unrest and resentment and contributed to the polarisation of the Reichstag in successive elections after 1919.

This polarisation, visible in the election of the conservative von Hindenburg as President as well as increasing support of far-left and far-right parties over the more moderate parties of the “Weimar coalition” in 1919. This represented a general lack of faith in parliamentary democracy (similar to that found in other parts of Europe in the interwar period, e.g., in Spain). On the one hand, much of the left refused to support the ‘dictatorship of the bourgeoisie’, with the KPD arguing that the SPD had betrayed the working class; instead, they preferred a socialist form of government. On the other hand, many on the right opposed democracy entirely, desiring a return to the past glory of the German Empire.

Although in the middle and later part of the decade the economic situation improved and a ‘golden age’ ensued, the Wall Street Crash in October 1929 ushered in another period of economic hardship, engendering a political situation comparable to that of 1919–23. The SPD and liberal parties again began to shrink, after a period of recovery, with the KPD gaining seats from the SPD. The far-right parties also began to grow. The growth of the KPD pushed the SPD to the right, adopting policies designed to attract centre and right-wing voters to make up for the losses on the left; in a period of mass unemployment, it pursued a program of dismantlement of the welfare state [@stephenson1997].

Until the critical period of 1929-33, Hitler and the NSDAP were relative outsiders in German politics, known if anything for the shambolic Munich putsch of 1923 and the subsequent trial. However, by October of 1929 the party was well-positioned to take advantage of the crisis. Its policies on agriculture and other topics were designed to appeal to the rural population, who even before the crash had been hurt by falling agricultural prices. They were also increasingly anti-Semitic in their policies and propaganda, either openly or covertly [@gellately2007].

The crash itself was exacerbated by the Versailles settlement which entailed reparations payments to France, payments which were supported by loans from the US. The financial situation in the US led to these loans being called in. The NSDAP’s stated intentions of rejecting Versailles here had a populist appeal — it could be seen to be responsible for Germany’s current economic hardship.

Further, the NSDAP’s anti-democratic stance won mainstream popularity. The ‘ineffectual’ Weimar government became another scapegoat for the problems. At the same time, von Hindenburg was increasingly forced to use emergency powers to govern, a mark of the Reichstag’s inability to come to any decision as much as of von Hindenburg’s antipathy towards democracy. The NSDAP promised to end such problems by application of the “Führerprinzip”, _leader principle_, by which the authority of the leader would be absolute; it later became a significant theme in NSDAP propaganda.

However, even by 1930 the rise to power of the NSDAP was not a foregone conclusion — a populace disillusioned by capitalism and democracy could have easily turned to the KPD. It has been argued that the KPD’s anti-capitalist rhetoric ‘terrified’ the majority, despite being the ‘party of the unemployed’ in a period of mass unemployment [@stephenson1997]. It has also been claimed that the history of anti-Semitism in Germany made the populace more accepting of NSDAP’s scapegoating; to some extent, a certain level of anti-Semitism was commonplace, even normal, and NSDAP propaganda played into this [@friedlander1997].

The collapse of the Weimar Republic was thus a result of the particular circumstances which coincided in Germany at the time: economic troubles, both short-term (the Wall Street Crash) and longer-term, left over from the Treaty of Versailles; a history of anti-liberal, anti-democratic, and anti-Semitic sentiment; and a flawed political system, with a divided government that permitted great power to be wielded by the President. The NSDAP was in a position to take advantage of all of these circumstances, while their rivals in the KPD were unable to do so; however, between these extremes the Republic itself stood little chance.
