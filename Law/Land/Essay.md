The modern law of property in England and Wales has taken shape by means of both common-law development and explicit statutory reform, over the course of most of the 20th century. However, there are significant shortcomings in these developments, and as of 2018 the law leaves much to be desired in terms of its relation to current social norms of property ownership. The current statutes were, for the most part, passed in the 1920s, a period with a comparatively very low level of home ownership (around ten percent of homes owner-occupied in 1914 and almost 90% privately rented, social housing then being almost non-existent).[^1] It was, furthermore, only seven years since the Representation of the People Act had removed the last property qualification for voting for men (and another three years until property qualifications for women would be removed). Thus, not only was home ownership much rarer at that time than it is now, but its social and political impact was different.

Since that point, however, changes to property law have been piecemeal, primarily through judicial decisions rather than statute. Further, those statutes that have been passed have either not related to shared ownership (for example, the Land Registration Act 2003); those which do relate, such as TOLATA 1996, are, to some extent, procedural rather than a change in the conceptual basis.

The problem of shared ownership arises from, firstly, the existence of two forms of shared ownership, with differing requirements and implications, and secondly, the varying ways in which these may arise. An express creation of joint tenancy is most straightforward; however, even this is not free from potential problems; the distinction between joint tenancy and tenancy in common is often not clear to home buyers, and the choice between the two may be made on the basis of an assumption on the part of their solicitor; moreover, a written instrument creating one or the other may vary in ways that seem relatively trivial, if these differences are construed as words of severance.

However, the more significant issues arise when shared ownership is not expressly created, but one or more parties make a claim to an equitable interest. There are, in turn, several forms that this equitable interest can take, and the distinctions between them are at times indistinct. A party without a formal interest in a property might assert a claim of a resulting trust, a constructive trust, or a proprietary estoppel; the prerequisites for each overlap, as do the potential remedies available, to the extent that a claimant will often argue for each of them in the alternative.

In the most straightforward cases, shared ownership has been established on the basis of contributions made to the purchase price by the second party: this will lead to a resulting trust, with the shares of equitable ownership being proportional to the share of the purchase price contributed by each party. This was so in _Laskar v Laskar_,[^2] _Wodzicki v Wodzicki_,[^3] and numerous others. Significantly, in more recent cases courts have considered that contributions to mortgage payments, and not only those to the initial payment, can form the basis of a resulting trust, aligning the law more closely with modern practice.

However, other payments do not count towards a resulting trust, and thus a claimant must argue for a constructive trust. Here the court is permitted greater discretion, both in terms of finding a basis for shared ownership and in determining the share for each party. The cornerstone of shared ownership by way of constructive trust is the finding of a ‘common intention’ that such shared ownership should exist (either creating a shared ownership of property that would otherwise be solely owned, or in granting to a party a share other than that to which they would be entitled on other grounds). The common intention must then have been relied upon by the claimant to some detriment, such that it would be ‘unconscionable’ for the claimant not to share in ownership. The criteria on which a common intention may be found have tended to expand over time; in particular, _Stack v Dowden_[^4] established that, as well as express promises, and intentions inferred from payments, an intention could be inferred from an ‘entire course of dealings’, with Hale SCJ giving examples of circumstances that might be taken into account, including the nature of the relationship between the parties, and the arrangement of their finances.

Already it is possible to see an overlap between these ostensibly separate concepts: a financial contribution may be found to be the basis of a resulting trust or as evidence of a common intention for a constructive trust. The question thus arises as to whether the two categories of trust need to be distinguished in practice. As discussed, a resulting trust is proportionate to the contribution of each party, while a constructive trust is left to the discretion of the court: but, in practice, the court may well allow its discretion to be guided by the contributions of the parties; for example, while _Stack v Dowden_ relates to a constructive trust and thus the court has discretion, a significant part of the judgment is taken up by a determination of the relative contributions of the parties.

The matter is further complicated by the impact of proprietary estoppel, which, in common with other forms of estoppel, requires a promise by one party upon which the other party relied to his or her detriment. Naturally this extends to many situations other than acquisition of an interest in a shared home; in the situation at hand, however, it has significant overlaps with a constructive trust. The primary distinction here is one of degree, rather than a fundamental difference; courts have been willing to find a proprietary estoppel on lesser facts than constructive trusts, and in particular might find a proprietary estoppel but grant some other remedy. For example, in _Southwell v Blackburn_,[^5] insufficient evidence was found for a common intention of shared ownership, but nevertheless considered that there had been detrimental reliance by the claimant on assurances made by the defendant, amounting to a financial loss.

Such a convergence may reflect the ad-hoc development of the law. As such a future reform could, for example, combine them and regularize the extent to which the court has discretion over the quantification of the interest, perhaps by using the relative contributions of the parties as a starting point but permitting discretion where appropriate. This would avoid cases like _Curley v Parkes_,[^6] where a claim for a resulting trust failed but (on the facts) a claim for a constructive trust might well have succeeded.

There is also a public policy basis for legal reform in this area, based on the continuing disparity in genders. There remains the concerning possibility of cases like _Bourne v Bourne_.[^7] In that case, cohabitation without an expressed common intention of co-ownership did not create a beneficial interest on the part of the claimant; domestic labour (housework and childcare) and expenditure on household chattels were not considered to be contributions to the acquisition of the property. While some of the leading cases around shared ownership disputes (including _Stack v Dowden_) have involved a male claimant and female defendant–proprietor, it remains the case that, with regard to opposite-sex couples, the female partner is disproportionately likely to be primarily responsible for domestic labour, while the male partner is in turn more likely to be primarily or solely responsible for earning a wage and thus, it is likely, for major expenditures. Feminist scholarship has long argued that, for this reason, domestic labour should be treated on a par with other work.

Moreover, even within the framework provided by the case law on equitable co-ownership, there could be found grounds to recognize a claim such as in _Burns_. Various cases have found that ‘substitutive’ contributions can be made towards the purchase price; for example, in _Mumford v Ashe_,[^8] it was considered possible that the right of one party to buy a house at a discount would create a financial interest in a property otherwise entirely paid for by a second party. Extending this principle, other non-monetary contributions by one party which permit the other party to make payments towards the acquisition price should in turn create a financial interest towards a resulting trust; thus, childcare by one partner which permits the other partner to work full-time rather than part-time creates a financial benefit for the latter partner by allowing them to earn more than they otherwise would, and thus pay the cost of acquisition more easily.

In short, the law as it stands does not reflect a coherent conceptual basis but rather is a product of a failure to keep pace with social developments, with several different strands of the law being brought together by the courts in an inconsistent manner to meet the needs of contemporary society in the absence of satisfactory legislation. Further, there is no compelling policy reason for the current state of the law (indeed, as it was not planned, there could be none), and certain policy issues which might justify a reform.
