The treaties establishing the European Community and later European Union did not define in detail the interaction between the Court of Justice and national courts. In short, article 234 TEC (later article 267 TFEU) laid out that national courts had the ability, and in some cases the obligation, to refer questions of Union law to the Court of Justice. Various specifics of this relationship, in particular the nature and extent of the obligation to refer, were established in case law over the subsequent decades. Furthermore, the article itself was used as a basis to support more general rights to rely on Union law in a national context. However, the process has not simply been one of increasing the power of the Court of Justice; practical and political concerns have in turn restricted the extent to which art 267 is applied.

%% case law

One of the earliest significant cases establishing a principle of law regarding art 267 was _Da Costa_.[^1] This case carved out a broad exception to the apparently absolute right and obligation created in the article itself, that of _acte éclairé_, i.e., precedent. Briefly, it held that the obligation did not apply when the question raised was materially identical to one already addressed in a previous ruling. While no such exemption to the obligation had been specified in the treaty, the Court of Justice considered that the existence of an identical ruling ‘deprived the obligation of its purpose and thus empty it of its substance’.

Going further, in _CILFIT_,[^2] the Court of Justice ruled that it was not necessary for national courts to make references if the provision of Union law was already sufficiently clear (the _acte clair_ principle); to determine whether this was the case, the national court was to have regard to a number of factors, including the various other language versions of the provision in question, and the general context and principles of Union law.

Conversely, in _Rheinmühlen_,[^3] the Court’s ruling broadened the scope of the right under art 267(2) to a significant extent. In that case, it held that the discretion to make a reference could not be fettered by procedural or jurisprudential rules of the national courts, such as a doctrine of binding precedent. Thus, every court was to have the right to make references, in situations where this was appropriate; to do otherwise would have a negative impact on the Court of Justice’s jurisdiction over Union law, and thus, it suggested, over the application of Union law in general.

This was later emphasized in _Lyckeskog_,[^4] where the question arose of which national courts were under a duty and which, on the other hand, merely had discretion to make a reference. Until that point it had not been determined whether only those courts which were the court of last instance in a general sense were under the duty, or whether it applied to courts which could, in some cases, be appealed against, but in others were the court of last resort. The Court of Justice held that the particular view was correct: that, if there was no appeal possible against a national court in some cases, then it would be under a duty to make preliminary references where necessary in those cases.

Yet the scope was still to be limited in practical terms; in _Simmenthal_[^5] the Court made clear that its jurisdiction did not extend to applying a principle of law to the facts of a particular case. This was reiterated in _Irish Creamery_,[^6] where the Court emphasized that its jurisdiction was Union, not national, law, and that as such, questions of fact and of national law should be settled first, so as to allow the reference to be properly contextualized — while, however, explicitly not limiting the national courts’ discretion to make a reference. Nevertheless, in a number of cases, such as _Telemarsicabruzzo_,[^7] the Court indeed found it impossible, given the facts, to make a ruling.

Indeed, the Court of Justice had already gone further, in _Pasquale Foglia_,[^8] by refusing to give a decision on references that it felt did not relate to genuine disputes but rather had been engineered in order to produce a conflict that, in turn, might have necessitated a judgment. The Court considered that its jurisdiction extended only to answering questions that were necessary for resolving ‘genuine disputes’, and that, since the parties were in fact in agreement (and gave almost identical statements to the court) there was no such dispute.

Conversely, however, in certain cases there would be an implied requirement to make a reference; in the _Foto-Frost_ case,[^9] the Court clarified that the discretion (rather than duty) granted to national courts to make preliminary references regarding the validity of Union acts did not imply the converse right to invalidate Union acts without a reference. While a national court was within its powers to decided, without making a reference, that the Union act was valid, it would not be able to find the act invalid without making a reference to the Court of Justice, and as such the Court of Justice and not the national court would make the declaration of invalidity.

Nor were there to be limitations as to which questions could be referred to the Court, provided (contra _Pasquale Foglia_) that they related to a genuine dispute: in _Dzodzi v Belgium_,[^10] though the dispute related to an affair entirely internal to one country, it involved reference to Union law (in particular, relating to immigration and freedom of movement); it was therefore manifestly within the Court’s jurisdiction to ensure a uniform interpretation of these provisions between member states (and, indeed, not within the Court’s jurisdiction to enquire as to how the dispute of interpretation arose, the facts of the case being a matter for the national court).

%% direct effect

As noted previously, beyond the direct application of art 267 itself, the Court of Justice has found in the words of the article a basis for extending other rights. In particular, this can be seen in the line of cases establishing an individual right to rely on provisions of European law in national courts (i.e., direct effect).

It was necessary for the Court of Justice to find such a basis because the treaties themselves had made clear that any power not provided for in the treaties remained with the respective member states. As such, in circumstances where it might be considered desirable for Union law to have force, it is necessary to provide a provision of the treaties which allows this either explicitly or impliedly.

This basis began to be established in _Van Gend en Loos_.[^11] The claimant sought to enforce a provision of the treaties[^12] against the Dutch customs authorities. Hitherto (only five or six years after the Treaty of Rome) there had been no recognition of the possibility for individuals or corporations to rely on treaty provisions in national courts. Nevertheless, the Court of Justice considered it necessary to achieve the aims of the treaties that individuals, and not just Union institutions, be able to rely on Union law directly. In order to do so, they considered that the preliminary reference procedure made reference to questions of Union law being raised in national courts, and found that this implied a right of individuals to rely on Union law directly:

> \12. […]() Community law therefore not only imposes obligations on individuals but is also intended to confer upon them rights which become part of their legal heritage. These rights arise not only where they are expressly granted by the Treaty, but also by reason of obligations which the Treaty imposes in a clearly defined way upon individuals as well as upon the Member States and upon the institutions of the Community.

The Court of Justice later built upon this decision in _Van Duyn v Home Office_,[^13] which extended the principle of direct effect to directives as well as treaty provisions: “Article [267] … implies further that these acts may be invoked by individuals in the national courts.”

%% expand upon this?

However the history of Article 267 in practice has not been one of unlimited expansion of Union power at the expense of national sovereignty (indeed, from the very beginning it has been a process of granting power to national institutions to enforce Union law). While the treaties have created a broad obligation to use the referral procedure, the Court of Justice has carved out certain exceptions, in a large part due to the necessity to maintain a manageable workload; these exceptions are _acte clair_ and _acte éclairé_, i.e., firstly, that references do not need to be made if the point of law can be considered sufficiently clear, and secondly, that references do not need to be made on points of law which have already been addressed by the Court of Justice in previous cases.

Furthermore, national courts have sometimes found ways to avoid making preliminary references. This may, for example, be for reasons of expediency, or because to do so would be politically problematic. Both of these reasons can be seen in _R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union_.[^14] In that case the possibility arose of addressing the question of the revocability of a notification under art 50(2) TEU. However, given first of all the strict time constraints of the case (that is, the two-year limit imposed by art 50(3)), and secondly the politically-sensitive nature of the case (relating directly to the relationship between UK and EU institutions) made it desirable to avoid a preliminary reference. As such, the UK Supreme Court, despite being the court of last instance, was able to avoid making a reference by framing the question in such a way as to avoid making a judgment on a point of Union law. Instead, since it was accepted as common ground by the parties that the notification was irrevocable, and as it was not directly relevant to the primary matter, the Court chose ‘to proceed on the basis that that is correct, without expressing any view of our own’. This allowed the case to proceed without a preliminary reference being made, while still permitting the point of law to be questioned in future proceedings, with the appropriate reference being made as necessary.

As such, it is clear that there has been no uniform trend of arrogating power to the Union institutions on the one hand, or of devolving power to national courts on the other; rather, the process has been one of developing nuance, where the Court of Justice has held it necessary to retain certain powers for the effective enforcement of the treaties, yet refuse other powers on the grounds of a lack of jurisdiction; nor have the national courts been purely passive participants in this process, but have been active in the negotiation of their own competencies.
